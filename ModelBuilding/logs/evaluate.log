('the following detailed description relates to certain embodiments of the inventive concepts of the present invention which are presented as examples and are not intended to limit the scope of the concept in any manner . additional variations may occur to those skilled in the art which would be within the parameters of the concepts of the invention . the present invention generally includes a snow plow pusher 10 which is attached to a straight plow blade 12 of a work vehicle 14 . suitable work vehicles with mounted plows may include but are not limited to skid steer vehicles , front end loaders , trucks , tractors , etc . the plow blades 12 to which the assembly attaches may include a variety of different blades made by different manufacturers . suitable blades typically do however make use of a trip edge mechanism 16 located along the bottom blade surface for safety . such a device will bend backwards against a spring mechanism if met by an obstruction on the surface being plowed . the snow pusher is largely made up of a main body 18 which is attached to the plow blade 12 by engagement of a pair of its j cam hooks 20 and a pair of brackets 22 . where brackets 22 are bolted to the snowplow blade 12 . when the arrangement is attached as shown in fig1 , the snow plow work vehicle will be capable of moving large amounts of snow greater distances that a typical plow blade due to the unique features of the plow vehicle that results . as seen in fig2 , the main body 18 of the snow pusher is largely made up of two plate - like side panels 24 joined together by a plurality of horizontal bars and cross members . the panels 24 may be made of metal , polymers , plastic , or aluminum . the panels 24 have flat surfaces which are generally perpendicular with respect to the horizontal plane of the ground . the two panels 24 are displaced from one another in a corresponding parallel manner such that they are similarly oriented and aligned . panels 24 are located on either side of a plow blade 12 when in use . the surface of panels 24 are therefore able to deflect and contain plowed snow that might escape from either end of the blade . the panels 24 can be seen to have a perimeter of angled edges 26 to maximize effectiveness in plowing through and containing snow . the angled edges 26 also are contoured to generally reflect the shape of the plow to assist in reducing excess snow build up . the panels 24 are also elevated slightly from the ground by a pair of skid plates 28 positioned below and to the outer side of the panels 24 . the plates 28 are made of replaceable material intended to wear during normal use . using such material helps accommodate the uneven surfaces which are being plowed . also found on the outside surfaces of the plates 28 are outer plate members 30 . outer plate members 30 are generally flat horizontal bars joined to the sides of the plates 28 . the plates 28 and the outer plate members 30 are attached to the panels 24 via bolts 32 which pass through outer plate members 30 , the skid plates 28 and panels 24 . various other well known methods of attaching the plates to the panels are contemplated by this invention as well . formed within the inside surface of both panels 24 is a seal member 34 . these members 34 are made of a strip of flexible material that sits against the flat inside edge of panel 24 in perpendicular relation . the flexible material curves from the top of the panel 24 to the bottom edge of the panel . seal member 34 protrudes a short distance inward from either plate end toward the center of the device . see fig3 . the seal &# 39 ; s flexible material is attached to the horizontal beams between the panels 24 as well as to an angle bracket 38 at the bottom of the panel 24 . the flexible material of seal member 34 simulates the contour of the moldboard of the snowplow blade to which it attaches . this seal member 34 closes the gap between the side panels 24 and each end of the snow plow blade 12 . accordingly , a seal member 34 will not allow snow to pass through a gap between the plow blade 12 and side panel 24 . alternatively , a seal member could also be used which was not flexible , but was formed to prevent the passage of snow between the plow blade 12 and side panel 24 . as seen in fig4 , the two side panels 24 are connected by two beams 40 and 42 . these beams are positioned in a perpendicular orientation with respect to the side panels 24 to join these similarly aligned plates . upper beam 40 extends between the tops of the plates 24 and the second lower beam 42 extends between locations found midway down the face of the plates 24 . the beams 40 and 42 may be made of metal or other suitable material and are welded to the plates 24 at both ends . alternatively , the plates 24 may be rigidly joined to the beams 40 and 42 with bolts or other attachment devices ( not shown ) for easy disassembly for replacement of a bent or damaged side plate 24 . while only two horizontal brace members are disclosed in this embodiment of the present invention , a design with a greater or lesser number of horizontal support beams is also contemplated . cushion material 44 is mounted on the rear facing side of the lower beam 42 to provide padding between the mold board making up the face of the plow blade 12 and the lower beam 42 . see fig3 . this cushion 44 is useful as the lower beam 42 generally takes the brunt of the pushing force and directs it into the curvature of the mold board of the plow . six diagonal brace members provide further support for the body member of the snow pusher . four of these are side brace members 46 . each of these members extends from locations on beams 40 and 42 which are inset a short distance from one of the four ends of the respective beams . the second end of these side brace members 46 is joined to a location near the front edge of the respective adjacent side panel members 24 . these four diagonal side brace members 46 thereby form structural supports for reinforcing the rigidity of the pusher . two additional diagonal braces 48 extend from the lower beam 42 to the upper beam 40 to attach with and support these members . these diagonal brace members 48 may also be referred to as cross members . these cross members are not straight , but rather are bent or contoured to accommodate the shape of the plow blade and pusher . also , a design utilizing a greater or lesser number of diagonal support beams than disclosed is also contemplated without departing from the scope of the invention . a pair of j cam hooks 20 are also integrally connected to the top beam 40 . each of these j cam hooks 20 projects rearwardly from the top beam 40 . the resulting hooks extending toward the plow 12 attached to work vehicle 14 that engages the snow pusher . the side surfaces of the j cam hooks 20 are positioned parallel with side panels 24 , and the top surfaces are angled up towards the rear in relation to the ground . additionally , the lower sloping surface 52 of each cam hook has an opening 54 in which a bracket may be placed to join the plow and pusher . also , integrated into the j cam hook 20 is the cam stop 64 which is the stop mechanism to prevent detaching of the pusher while in use . see fig8 . this type of arrangement allows for easy alignment when connecting the snow pusher body 18 and plow blade 12 . the upper beam 40 and attached j cam hooks 20 keep the apparatus in position on the plow when the snow pusher is in use . therefore , the j cam hooks , forces exerted by work vehicle movement , and gravity are the means by which the snow pusher is kept in position during normal operation . corresponding to the pair of j cam hooks 20 are a pair of brackets 22 which are mounted to the top of the back surface of the plow blade 12 . these brackets 22 are bolted to the plow blade such that they are located in equal spaced apart relation with respect to the center of the blade . the brackets 22 are formed such that they have a curved base plate 58 having a radius bend simulating the curvature of the moldboard of the plow to which it is attached . from that base extend two curved vertical plate members 60 that reach a height slightly above the top of the plow blade 12 . joining each of the pairs of vertical plate members 60 is a horizontal cam bar 66 and a shaft or pipe 62 . it is these shafts 62 to which the j cam hooks 20 are joined and that enable pivotal latching by this invention . alternatively , it is also contemplated by this invention to use vertical plate members 60 which are not attached to the curved base plate 58 , but rather are integrally formed directly with the plow blade . forming the vertical plate members 60 with the plow could be done by welding or during manufacture of the plow blade . attachment of the vertical plate members 60 in this way would eliminate the need to bolt a curved base plate 58 to the plow . moreover , it is also within the scope of the present invention to use bracket and hook members attached in an opposite configuration to the one shown in the figures . for example , the hook members may be rigidly attached to the blade of the plow and the bracket members may be rigidly attached to the support assembly . such modifications would allow for a similar manner of releasable attachment and do not depart from the teaching of this invention . further , although only a pair of j - cam hooks 20 and a pair of corresponding brackets 22 is shown in this embodiment , using additional hooks and brackets for support is also contemplated by the present invention . for example , using three or more j - cam hooks 20 and corresponding brackets 22 may be necessary in designs with particularly large plow attachments or for designs seeking to be more integrally connected to the plow blade . the method by which the j cam hooks 20 and plow blade 12 connect with the brackets 22 can be seen in fig5 - 7 . initially the plow blade 12 and mounted brackets 22 are separate from the j cam hooks 20 and the main body of the pusher 18 . first , an operator tips forward the plow blade 12 of his work vehicle 14 such that the blade face is roughly parallel to the plane of the ground , as seen in fig5 . next , the operator moves the work vehicle and plow forward to align the brackets 22 with the openings 54 in j cam hooks 20 , as seen in fig6 . next , the operator rotates the plow blade 12 back into a plowing position where the plow blade is roughly perpendicular with the ground , as seen in fig7 . as disclosed , the bracket members 22 generally are joined in such a way that they are hooked and then rotated until the cam bar 66 of the bracket meets the cam stop 64 ( i . e . brace member ) of the hook . see fig8 . this configuration prevents the snow pusher from becoming disconnected unless the operator reverse rotates , or tilts the plow to the ground . if an operator were to conduct such a reverse rotation maneuver , the cam bar 66 of the bracket 22 would be drawn away from the cam stop of the hook allowing the shaft 62 of the bracket 22 to be removed from the j cam hook 20 and thereby disconnect the snow pusher body 18 from the snow plow 12 . therefore , operation of the snow plow pusher device to clean an area containing a road and intersecting driveways is as follows . first , the work vehicle utilizes the plow blade 12 of his or her vehicle to back drag snow from the various driveways onto the main road . this is done with a work vehicle 14 using a plow blade 12 with the bracket members 22 attached to its rear surface . no substantial interference to normal plow operation is caused by brackets 22 . next , an operator loads the body 18 of the snow pusher device onto the plow blade 12 by driving up to the main body 18 of the pusher , rotating the plow blade such that its face is roughly parallel to the plane of the ground , and driving the vehicle forward until the pipes 62 of the brackets 22 mounted on the plow align with the openings 54 in the j cam hooks 20 . next , the plow blade 12 is rotated such that the blade is roughly perpendicular to the ground in a normal plowing configuration , and such that the main pusher body 18 is securely attached to the snow plow blade . the operator next drives the vehicle down the main road where the snow has accumulated . because of the attachment of the pusher member a large amount of snow is able to be pushed down the road to a desired location very quickly and with relatively few passes . further , because the plow blade retains the ability to angle itself with the pusher member attached , greater versatility and effectiveness of use is retained with the new device . and furthermore , with the pusher member attached , the trip edge mechanism 16 on the plow blade retains its full range of motion , thus retaining the safety feature for which the trip edge was intended . when areas along the road and driveway need touch up work or additional plowing the main pusher body 18 can easily and quickly be removed . the operator may do this by rotating the plow blade forward until the blade is roughly horizontal and the pusher attachment drops out of the j cam member 20 . the attachment can be left in any convenient location and the work vehicle can leave to perform work with the plow blade on its own . this configuration and attachment method allows the quick and repeated conversion of a snow plow into a snow pusher box and vice versa . clearing snow from a location in this way results in an area where snow has been rapidly removed and transported in an efficient manner without requiring the operator to leave the cab of his or her work vehicle . an alternate embodiment of the snow pusher is shown in drawing fig9 a - 14 . it is noted generally by the referenced character 100 . an associated plow blade assembly is shown at 102 which may be attached to any conventional work vehicle , as the example show at 14 in fig1 . the snow plow blade 104 is attached to a work vehicle as by an attachment assembly 105 which , of course , may take any of several forms and which generally allows the plow blade 104 to pivot in both a generally horizontal plane and also in a generally vertical plane as by using hydraulic cylinders 106 and 108 which are connected between the attachment assembly and the lower portion of the plow blade 104 . hydraulic hose connections are shown at 110 and 112 to supply hydraulic fluid to operate the plow mechanisms . the plow blade itself is provided with a generally concave pushing surface 114 and includes a safety trip edge mechanism 116 connected to allow bottom edge attachment 118 to react to uneven terrain in a well known manner . spaced clamping mechanisms or hydro - clamps are shown at 120 and more clearly described in the enlarged views of fig9 c and 10c and fig1 . the snow pusher devices themselves , as was the case with earlier described devices , include two spaced plate - like generally vertically disposed side panels 130 joined together by a plurality of horizontal structural members as at 132 and 134 and may be further strengthened by a plurality of generally horizontally disposed corresponding strut members as at 136 and 138 . whereas only one side may be shown in some of the figures , the construction is intended to be symmetrical and corresponding opposite hand struts are provided in a well known manner and as shown in fig1 . as was the case in earlier embodiments , the panels 130 may be made of metal , polymers , plastic or aluminum and are provided with relatively flat surfaces which are generally perpendicular with respect to the horizontal plane of the ground . the panels are further disposed in spaced parallel relation , as indicated and as maintained by the structural members and struts . the rear portions of the snow pusher 100 are correspondingly shaped to be compatible with the ends of the plow blade 104 . the panels 130 are also preferably elevated from the ground by a pair of skid plates 140 which are generally fastened to the side panels as by a plurality of bolts 142 as shown in the figures . the skid plates are designed to provide bottom wear surfaces to the side plates and are designed to be easily removable and replaceable as by removing the bolts 142 . other reinforcing bars such as the flat plates shown at 144 and 146 which are symmetrically placed to strengthen the side panels . these may also be conveniently bolted in place in a well known manner . it should be noted that the back side of the pusher device is generally open and a closure is supplied by the plow blade 104 . in this regard , seal members as at 148 are provided on both attached as at 150 are provided in relation to both side panels 130 and are contoured to match the contoured face 114 of the plow blade 104 . these members may be made of a strip of flexible material that can be removed and replaced as indicated and which provides a positive seal between the side panels 130 and the plow blade 104 . alternatively , a seal member could also be fabricated from a rigid material shaped to close the gap between the plow blade 104 and the side panels 130 . the pusher device also includes shaped heavy shaft members 152 attached between reinforcing plates as shown in the figures . the members 152 are elongated parallel to the structural members 132 and 134 between the side panels 130 and are used to attach the snow pusher 100 to a plow blade 104 using the mechanisms 120 as will be described . as indicated above , fig1 shows an opposite hand view of the snow pusher assembly from that pictured in fig9 a and 10a and shows the symmetrical construction of the device . the clamping mechanisms or hydro - clamps 120 are best seen in the greatly enlarged perspective view of fig1 and detail fig1 a and 13b . each of these mechanisms includes a pair of spaced , shaped heavy gusset members 160 connected by a cross brace 162 , a rotating hook 164 mounted on a shaft 166 journaled between gussets 160 . the operating end of the hook is attached to the rod end of a cylinder 168 as by a clevis connection at 170 in a well known manner . the blind end of the cylinder is also connected via a plate 172 and connection 174 to the plow blade 104 such that extending and retracting the rod of the cylinder 168 rotates the free end of the hook 164 . the forward shape configuration of the gussets 160 enables the members 162 to slide over the shaft members 152 to thereby provide guide surfaces that assist in the latching process that assists in guiding the attachment assembly into position . the hook itself , as shown best in fig1 a and 13b , may be fixed to a bearing or bushing 180 on a shaft on page 166 which is also mounted between gusset plates 160 . fig9 a shows the pusher 100 and plow blade 104 separated and fig1 a shows the snow pusher 100 connected with the plow blade 104 . note that the connecting pipes or rods 152 enable the hooks 164 to operate anywhere along the rods or pipes 152 to facilitate alignment of the plow blade 104 with the pusher as can be seen from the figures . with the cylinders 168 extended , the hook 164 is in the open position enabling the snow pusher and plow blade to be separated or for the plow blade to approach the snow pusher for connection . in fig1 a - 10c , the hook is shown in the hooked position with the cylinders 168 in the retracted position . fig1 shows the snow pusher connected with the plow blade in a rear perspective that includes an alternate work vehicle attachment assembly 200 . this system enables the plow to connect and disconnect the show pusher readily with the plow blade in a substantially vertical orientation or one that is roughly perpendicular to the ground in a normal plowing configuration . as with other models , the work vehicle to which the plow blade is attached , approaches the rear of the snow pusher and thereafter uses the plow blade cylinders if minor adjustments are needed to align the clamping mechanisms with the shaft members 152 height - wise . thereafter , the cylinders 168 can be operated to attach the snow pusher to the plow blade readily with the operator remaining in the work vehicle . likewise , the steps can be reversed in separating the plow blade from the snow pusher by simply extending the cylinders 168 and thereby releasing the hooked shafts 152 . those skilled in the art will appreciate that the snow pusher of the present invention may be manufactured in a variety of shapes and sizes to accommodate various sizes and types of work vehicles , plow blades , and work vehicle attachments . the invention has been described herein in considerable detail in order to comply with the patent statutes and to provide those skilled in the art with the information needed to apply the novel principles and to construct and use such specialized components as are required . however , it is to be understood that the invention can be carried out by specifically different equipment and devices , and that various modifications , both as to the equipment and operating procedures , can be accomplished without departing from the scope of the invention itself .', 'referring to fig1 a float 10 is constructed from a metal blade 12 , preferably made of magnesium , and a handle 14 which is mounted to the blade along blade mounts 16 . mounts 16 are formed integrally with blade 12 and provide a pair of coplanar mounting surfaces 17 against which handle 14 is secured . a pair of screws 18 secure handle 14 to the blade by mating with threaded recesses ( not shown ) formed in mounts 16 . referring now to fig2 and 7 , handle 14 is constructed from an outer thermoplastic elastomer layer 21 ( fig2 ) which is molded onto an inner support core 20 ( fig7 ). core 20 extends throughout the length of the handle providing the primary structural component of the handle , while elastomer layer 21 provides a substantial covering to the core . core 20 may be formed from a suitable rigid material , such as polypropylene , and may be molded by an injection molding process . as shown in fig4 and 6 , core 20 is formed from two identical core components 22 which are fitted or engaged together prior to the molding of outer layer 21 . each core component 22 has a mounting nose 24 and a half grip portion 26 . mounting nose 24 is comprised of a base section 28 having a flat bottom surface 30 of a size for engagement against one of the flat mounting surfaces 17 of the blade . half grip portion 26 extends upwardly and laterally from mounting nose 24 to provide a u - shaped grip recess 29 beneath the handle and above the blade to allow space for the user &# 39 ; s fingers . half grip portion 26 is open along one of its sides permitting inspection of its internal ribbed structure 31 . half - grip portion 26 is formed of a curved wall member 40 ( fig6 ) terminating in a lowermost edge surface 32 and an uppermost edge surface 34 at the open side . edge surfaces 32 , 34 are coplanar and define the vertical mating plane of the two core components . surfaces 32 , 34 are configured to mate with the like edge surfaces of the other core component 22 . core component 22 has a large area engagement surface 36 disposed along the proximal edge of nose 24 and a large area engagement surface 38 disposed along the proximal edge of half grip portion 26 . engagement surfaces 36 , 38 are planar in configuration being disposed parallel to one another and substantially perpendicular to the plane of bottom surface 30 . while engagement surface 36 extends across the entire proximal side of nose 24 , only one - half of the surface is presented for engagement . rib structure 31 is formed of a plurality of ribs 44 extend between edges 32 , 34 and extending laterally to the inside surface 42 ( fig6 ) of the curved wall member 40 . ribs 44 support and strengthen wall member 40 preventing it from collapsing under compressive forces applied during tool manufacture and use . a center rib 46 is disposed between edges 32 and 34 , providing additional support . rib 46 likewise extends laterally to inside surface 42 of the curved wall member . a pair of male bosses 48 and a pair of female recesses 50 are located along center rib 46 and are arranged for mating with a counterpart boss or recess in the other core component when the two core components are mated together . as shown in fig5 islands 52 are integrally formed onto the outer surface of wall member 40 , and are not covered by layer 21 , as shown in fig2 . islands 52 are oblong , and protrude a uniform distance from the outer surface of wall member 40 . islands 52 serve on an area in which to hold the components 22 firmly together in place when thermoplastic layer 21 is molded onto core 20 . similar islands 53 ( fig3 ) and 54 ( fig2 ) protrudes outwardly from the nose and grip portion edge 32 , nose 24 , as shown in fig2 . referring now to fig7 two identical core components 22 are engaged to form core 20 . when the identical core components are engaged , the lowermost edge surfaces 32 and uppermost edge surfaces 34 of the components 22 are contiguous and preferably flush with one another along their outer extent . the engagement surface 36 of one component 22 is directly contiguous with the engagement surface 38 of the other component 22 . the edges of surfaces 36 , 38 are flush when the components are engaged . the male bosses 48 of each component 22 engage the female recesses of the other component 22 . the engagement of the two core components 22 creates core 20 , with flush transitions on the outer surface thereof along the lines of intersection of the two components 22 . it will be appreciated that in engagement , the ribs 44 , 46 of the two components 22 are contiguous for maximum compressive resistance . this symmetry is created by molding the core components 22 from the same or substantially identical , molds . it will be appreciated that creating only one mold increases productivity and decreases the costs associated with fabricating component 22 . referring now to fig5 and 8 , each mounting nose 24 has a mounting ring 54 that provides flat bottom surface 30 which interfaces with one of the mounting surfaces 17 of blade 12 . mounting ring 54 is a closed loop that defines a recessed void 56 ( fig8 ). an inner ring surface 57 is ribbed in configuration ( fig5 ) being disposed in a plane space above the plane of bottom surface 30 and defining the vertical extent of recessed void 56 . referring to fig8 nose 24 is formed on outer wall member 55 and an internal ribbed structure 59 . a cylinder 58 is secured in the internal ribbed structure extending upwardly from mounting void 56 and having its cylindrical axis disposed perpendicular to lower surface 30 . cylinder 58 defines a bore of a diameter that accepts mounting screw 18 . the diameter is larger than the diameter of the threads of screw 18 . the upper end of cylinder 58 is flared outwardly defining a mounting lip 62 which provides a lip surface 63 extending beyond the diameter of cylinder 58 . lip surface 63 serves as a seat for the head of mounting screw 18 . as screw 18 is tightened , lip 62 transfers the force of the screws to the rib structure 59 causing the cylinder 58 and its supporting rib structure 59 to flex to a relative small degree . mounting void 56 facilitates the flexing . this flexing provides preload force which establishes an upward bias on the head of screws 18 . the resulting bias maintains a tight engagement of mounting screw 18 with the threaded recesses in mounting surface 17 securing the screw in position . additionally , this preload maintains constant contact between surface 30 and mounting surface 17 as the float is worked . this preload maintains a seal between surface 30 and surface 17 that prevents moisture or any other like material from violating the threads of the screw 18 or the threaded recesses of mounting surfaces 17 . a truncated cylinder 64 is secured in the internal ribbed structure 59 above cylinder 58 . cylinder 64 has a diameter larger than that of cylinder 58 and extends upwardly from lip 62 . screw 18 is received in cylinder 64 during assembly of the handle to the blade . cylinder 64 is truncated along the outer curved surface of mounting nose 28 . mounting ring 54 also flexes under the load provided by mounting screw 18 when it is fastened to blade 12 . the flexing of mounting ring 54 further allows the mounting nose 28 to seal against mounting surface 17 when the two surfaces 30 , 17 are engaged by the pressure applied by the tightening of mounting screw 18 . this seal helps to form a moisture tight barrier between handle 14 and blade 12 . the seal formed by these components allows the handle to give - and - take over the life of the tool . as shown in fig5 and 8 , lateral ribs 66 and longitudinal rib 68 extend upwardly from mounting void 56 to an outer wall member 55 of mounting nose 28 . lateral ribs 66 and longitudinal rib 68 are perpendicular to each other . ribs 66 and 68 provide a support structure for the outer wall 60 of mounting nose 28 , and distribute the load from mounting screw 18 to mounting ring 54 . the outer wall member 55 , the ribs 66 , 68 and cylinders 58 , 64 are integrally molded together with core component 22 as one piece . thermoplastic elastomer layer 21 is injection molded around core 20 . the thermoplastic layer may be made out of any suitable material that is capable of providing a soft grippable surface for the handle , such as santoprene tm elastomer . in the preferred embodiment , the material used to mold the core 20 is of the same base carrier resin as thermoplastic layer 21 . this affords both a mechanical and thermal bond between core 20 and thermoplastic layer 21 . it is necessary to hold core 20 firmly in place during while thermoplastic layer 21 is applied around core 20 . core 20 may be held in place , at least in part , by applying forces to the islands 52 and 53 that protrude outwardly from the surface 40 of core 20 . the necessary forces may be applied by the mold used to form thermoplastic layer 21 . after thermoplastic layer 21 is molded around core 20 , the outwardly presented surface of islands 52 are exposed and flush with thermoplastic layer 21 . referring to fig8 thermoplastic layer 21 extends downward to cover the inner wall of cylinder 64 , and terminates at lip 62 . extending thermoplastic layer 21 along the walls of cylinder 64 decreases the likelihood that thermoplastic layer 21 will snag or shear over the life of the tool . referring to fig9 in the preferred embodiment of the present invention , a tongue 70 and groove 72 arrangement is provided along edges 32 and 34 . grooves 72 extend along edges 32 and 34 to the mid - point of half grip portion 26 . tongues 72 extend from the mid - point of half grip portion 26 to the intersection of plane 38 edges 32 and 34 . when two core components 22 are engaged , the tongues 70 of one core component engage the grooves 72 of the other core component 22 and vice versa . while only one preferred embodiment of the invention has been discussed above , those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize and appreciate that this embodiment may be modified and altered without departing from the central spirit and scope of the invention . thus , the preferred embodiments described above is to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive , the scope of the invention being indicated by the appended claims , rather than by the foregoing description , and all changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are intended to be embraced herein .', 'the simplest embodiment shown in fig1 has only an interchangeable bottom plate although the inner walls of the support bell 2 can also be protected by disposable parts possibly to be replaced less often . in fig1 the securing on the extension 3 is by simple insertion into a matching plug - type connecting sleeve 7 on the plate 6 which is rotatably connected with an eye or the like to the plate 5 . although this embodiment is of greater simplicity it has a number of disadvantages which are obviated in the embodiment shown in fig2 to 4 . fig2 shows a support bell 2 in which the stick 1 is made tubular and terminates on the upper side of the housing 11 for an electric motor . the shaft of the electric motor forms in this case part of the extension 3 . the shaft 8 is tubular and slit once or more in the longitudinal direction . extending through its axis into the hollow tubular stick 1 is a core rod 9 which is movable in the axial direction and which comprises at its end a thickening or projecting which interact with corresponding associated faces of the tubular shaft 8 in such a manner that the portions lying between the slits are expanded when the core rod 9 is moved in the axial direction towards one side . the thickening or the projections can have any desired known forms . thus , the thickening may be a sphere , a ball or a similar conical body which cooperates with correspondingly inclined or curved faces of the tubular shaft 8 and thus expands said tubular shaft 8 . instead of one projection however projections or similar wedges can be provided extending in correspondingly formed slits in the tubular shaft 8 . by pulling the core rod 9 against the engagement faces of the tubular shaft 8 the latter is expanded . in the device according to the invention the core rod 9 is usually biased in the sense of expansion of the tubular shaft 8 , for example with the aid of a mechanism as shown in fig4 and located in the grip portion of the stick 1 . in this mechanism a pressure spring 12 pushes the core rod 9 upwardly . by actuating a lever 10 the core rod 9 is moved downwardly , overcoming the spring force , and this leads to the resilient tubular shaft 8 no longer being expanded and its diameter being reduced . since , as explained below , on actuation of the means the electric motor rotates the tubular shaft 8 through about half a revolution , either the thickening on the core rod 9 must also be rotatable or the entire core rod 9 must be rotatable or twistable in the region indicated . if the core rod 9 is made of a resilient twistable plastic material having adequate tensile strength it is not necessary to provide any bearings for a rotation of the core rod 9 . the device according to the invention is made ready for use in that the tubular shaft 8 shown in fig2 is relieved by downward movement of the core rod 9 and is introduced into a usually sleeve - shaped plug - type connection piece 7 of an interchangeable receiving insert 4 . the core rod 9 is then moved upwardly , usually with relieving of the pressure spring at its other end , and expands the tubular shaft 8 so that a reliable slip - proof connection is established between the tubular shaft 8 , forming in the present case the outer periphery of the extension 3 , and the plug - type connecting piece 7 . on insertion the plates 5 and 6 are usually disposed one behind the other so that part of the bottom face , usually half thereof , is open . the receiving member may be a simple circular disc which is made up of the two plates 5 and 6 and held in the lower edge region of the support bell 2 by corresponding annular extensions or it may have a drawn - up cylindrical edge which covers the peripheral walls of the support bell 2 ; alternatively , it may be almost completely closed and have a passage for pushing through the extension 3 only opposite the plug - type connecting piece 7 . the form which the receiving member 4 is given will depend on considerations regarding price , space requirement and hygiene . in use the device described in fig2 to 4 is placed with its bottom face half open over a heap of droppings , the electric motor is then actuated , preferably with the aid of a switch disposed on the grip portion , and the electric motor turns the movable sector - shaped ( approximately semi - circular ) plate 5 through about 180 °. the plate 5 moves in the manner of a scoop beneath the droppings and collects them in the interior of the support bell 2 . the droppings can then remain for the remainder of the walk in the support bell and at a suitable point placed in refuse together with the receiving insert 4 , this being done by simply pulling the lever 10 shown in fig4 to compress the pressure spring , the receiving member then dropping out of the support bell . when the receiving member 4 is closed all round it can be disposed of in very hygienic manner . since the receiving member 4 is a disposable article and should preferably not lead to any problems in refuse , it is preferably made of a paper of adequate strength , the moving plate 5 however preferably being made of a cardboard of adequate strength . the actual device may be made of any materials and material combinations , that is metal , wood and plastic , plastic materials possibly being preferably for costs reasons . the electric motor provided in the preferred embodiment is battery driven , arrangement of the battery in the stick , the grip portion of the stick or the support bell not presenting any problems . instead of an electric motor in a modification of the embodiment illustrated a spring motor ( clockwork ) can be used which can be wound up for example by depressing a rod projecting at the bottom out of the support bell and arrested in the wound - up position , being releasable via an actuating means in the grip portion . such a modified embodiment is also within the scope of the present invention . as already described , the receiving insert 4 retains with its one plate 5 a substantially fixed position with respect to the support bell 2 . this is necessary to guarantee a closing of the bottom face during pivoting of the pivotal plate 6 . the required locking of the plate 6 of the receiving insert 4 can simply be provided in various manner . for example , the support bell 2 may be provided with a projection which engages in a recess of the receiving insert 4 to prevent a rotation of the latter and may be located in the area of the lower circumferencial edge , the side wall or also on the cover plate of the support bell 2 . as has also been mentioned , the support bell 2 may be perforated or of basket shape . such a design allows an optical control during opening of the receiving insert 4 . for this purpose , markings may additionally be provided at suitable locations . alternatingly , a support bell made of transparent material may be used . since the receiving insert is locked with respect to the support bell and thus is always arranged therein in the same manner , it is also possible to provide markings on the walking - stick for indicating the rotation of the extension 3 and thus the open or closed position of the receiving insert . while the invention has been illustrated and described as embodied in collecting means for dog droppings , it is not intended to be limited to the details shown since various modifications and structural changes may be made without departing in any way from the spirit of my present invention .', 'referring now to the drawings where the preferred embodiment is illustrated as an assemblage of interlocking separate trough sections 10 , with each trough section 10 being identical in structure and function . thus the principal invention , trough section 10 , is a one - piece metal trough section longitudinally half rounded having an inwardly curved surface 22 and an outwardly curved surface 24 and having connectable ends . for descriptive purposes , the connectable ends are designated first longitudinal end 38 and second longitudinal end 40 . see fig1 and 2 . the connectable ends allow multiple duplicates 42 of trough section 10 to be connected end to end to produce a single support member 29 adjustable in length for a sewer hose 30 . see fig5 and 6 . although duplicates 42 of trough section 10 could vary in length to produce a specifically measured single support member 29 , the usefulness of single support member 29 is not effected when all duplicates 42 of trough sections 10 are equal in length . to make the connection , adjacent one end of each half round trough section 10 is a narrow transverse rectangular slot 12 provided along one longitudinal inner edge with a short protruding outwardly curved lip - like flange , locking lip 14 . locking lip 14 projects from the edge of rectangular slot 12 transversely to trough section 10 on the outwardly curved surface 24 of trough section 10 . for instructional simplicity , each trough section 10 has a designated attachment end , attachment end 28 . aligning several trough sections 10 for attachment is easily accomplished by positioning all attachment ends 28 in a line away from each other . to fasten two lengths of trough sections 10 together , a flange 18 is provided at the end of each trough section 10 opposite the end in which rectangular slot 12 is cut . this flags the designated attachment end , attachment end 28 . flange 18 slips inside of locking lip 14 and the end locks inside of the curved lip of locking lip 14 when two trough sections 10 are twisted together with flange 18 and locking lip 14 aligned for attachment . see illustrations of the twist method of attaching two trough sections 10 together in fig3 and 4 . to provide leverage locking , between rectangular slot 12 on the opposite side of locking lip 14 is a rounded tab , locking tab 16 , raised in the outwardly curved surface 24 of trough section 10 . locking tab 16 has a short support base end and is angled over with a major rounded end portion paralleling the outwardly curved surface 24 of trough section 10 . locking tab 16 is positioned to snap into locking tab aperture 20 which is in the end of trough section 10 adjacent the flange 18 end . as illustrated in fig3 and 4 , when the two trough sections 10 are twisted together with locking lip 14 and flange 18 interlocked , locking tab 16 slides into locking tab aperture 20 and lever locks the trough sections 10 together until untwisting releases them . see fig5 . although , as illustrated in fig3 and 4 , a clockwise twist locks trough sections 10 together and a counterclockwise twist unlocks the sections , trough sections 10 can be manufactured for locking and unlocking by twisting either direction . fig5 shows two trough sections 10 locked together in a view from the bottom or outwardly curved surface 24 . locking lip 14 is over and retaining flange 18 and longitudinal separation is prevented by locking tab 16 slid into locking tab aperture 20 in a twist - locked position . the rounded upper flat surface of locking tab 16 is levered against the outwardly curved surface 24 of trough section 10 and the sections remain firmly locked until a reverse twist unlocks them . fig6 illustrates sewer hose 30 being supported by attached trough sections 10 formed into one long support member 29 . sewer hose 30 rests cradled in the inwardly curved surfaces 22 of the attached trough sections 10 . support member 29 is retained elevated adjacent holding tank outlet 32 by tether cord 36 . tether cord 36 passes through tether apertures 26 around under the end trough section 10 and is fastened to any protruding fixture usually available on vehicle 34 in a manner as shown to support the upper end of support member 29 . although not shown , the lower end of support member 29 rests against the ground or the edge of the sewer inlet platform so long as sufficient fall is provided for adequately draining the rv holding tank . when used as shown in fig6 the present invention adequately supports and protects sewer hose 30 from ground damage and from sagging during use . after use , with sewer hose 30 removed , a counterclockwise rotation of each trough section 10 will disengage flanges 18 from locking lips 14 , and locking tab aperture 20 from locking tab 16 . all disconnected trough sections 10 can be stacked one inside the other for compact storage , which saves the already limited available space in most rv &# 39 ; s . although i have described my invention in detail in the previous specification , it would be obvious to one skilled in the art that it is possible to make alterations in the design of the attachment fittings or the structure of trough section 10 and still produce a sewer hose 30 support member 29 in a system having the same function as my invention . i therefore reserve the right to incorporate modifications in the structure and design of my device insofar as those changes remain within the scope of the appended claims and to claim as my invention the same restricted modifications made by others to my device .', 'fig1 illustrates a pressure toilet 10 having a tank 12 , a bowl 14 , a jet channel 16 ( see fig2 ) and a trapway 18 according to the present invention . except for the trapway , the toilet can be any suitable pressure toilet , such as the two piece low volume flush design shown in fig1 , providing a pressurized water stream in any known manner , including for example using direct water line pressure , accumulating a volume of pressurized water in the tank , or proving a sump pump for pressurizing the tank water . u . s . pat . nos . 5 , 305 , 475 and 5 , 046 , 201 disclose examples of pressure assist toilets having mechanisms for generating the water jet suitable for use here . the disclosure of the features for generating and conveying the pressurized water in these patents is hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein . in any such manner , water pressurized to greater than atmospheric pressure is passed from the tank 12 through the jet channel 16 . typically , the jet channel 16 is a passage formed in the vitreous base of the toilet and wraps around the front of the bowl 14 so that its outlet is directed toward the rear of the toilet . the jet channel 16 can terminate in a bowl sump 20 , the trapway 18 ( in an up leg thereof ) or at the junction of the trapway 18 and a bowl opening 22 , provided it directs the water jet to force the waste within the bowl into the trapway 18 . in the toilet 10 shown in fig1 , the jet channel 16 terminates at the bowl sump 20 with the water jet passing through opening 23 . as shown in fig1 and 2 , the trapway 18 extends from the bowl opening 22 along a serpentine path in a generally hairpin configuration with an oblong rounded or somewhat cross - section ( as shown in fig3 and 4 ). the base of the toilet 10 has an outlet 24 , preferably contained within an essentially horizontal plane , at the bottom which the trapway 18 that mounts over the open end of a waste plumbing line ( not shown ). the trapway 18 thus creates a path for contents in the bowl 14 to flow to the waste line during a flush cycle . referring to fig2 , an up leg 26 of the trapway 18 extends back from the bowl opening 22 upward and rearward to a bend , the inside diameter of which forms a weir or water dam 28 , after which point water can pass through the downstream portion of the trapway 18 . at , or immediate downstream from the dam 28 is an enlarged volume “ blow out ” region 30 which has a larger sectional area to accommodate the waste and water forced rapidly through the up leg 26 by the water jet . its large size reduces the likelihood of waste blow back into the bowl . a down leg 32 extends from the dam 28 downward and forward down to an opening 34 which aligns with the toilet outlet 24 . the dam 28 follows a tight radius such so as to change the flow direction through the down leg 32 about 180 degrees from the direction of flow through the up leg 26 . adjacent the opening 34 at the bottom end of down leg 32 , the trapway 18 has a short , flat horizontal baffle 36 extending between the rear wall of the down leg 32 . the baffle 36 works to disrupt flow through the down leg 32 . for liquid and very low bulk waste , the baffle 36 improves flow by generating turbulence low in the down leg 32 . for larger bulk waste , the baffle 36 works to accumulate bulk in the down leg 32 to achieve the necessary concentration of bulk material necessary to start a siphon , and to do so earlier in the flush cycle . the trapway 18 is configured and sized specifically to consistently achieve a siphon pull within the trapway 18 to assist the water jet when evacuating large amounts of bulk waste from the bowl 14 during a flush cycle . the trapway 18 is further designed to achieve the siphon only when a threshold concentration of bulk material is present within the trapway , that is when sufficient solid waste is present in the trapway 18 . no siphon is established when liquid only or insufficient bulk ( below the concentration threshold ) is present in the trapway . the bulk waste concentration within the down leg 32 is believed to be of particular significance , and it is in this region that the bulk waste concentration threshold is considered . with reference to fig5 , the following table 1 summarizes the values determined to be acceptable and preferred for the various design parameters of the trapway . the values given for the above parameters are dependent on the volume of water in the bowl as well as the volume and rate of water injected through the jet channel during the flush cycle . these values are given in the following table 2 . the inventors have determined empirically that the dam 28 radius ( r ) and the angle ( θ u ) of the up leg 26 from horizontal parameters are most sensitive with respect to bulk waste and the ability to achieve a siphon . the angle ( od ) of the down leg 32 has a moderate effect , as does the location and configuration of the baffle 34 ( l b ) and ( h b ). the inventors have also determined that a trapway having such configuration can develop a siphon when the bulk waste concentration within the down leg 32 is between 2 % and 5 % by weight ( including liquid mass ), with the preferred bulk waste concentration threshold being 2 . 5 % by weight . the dam radius ( r ) between the up leg 26 and the down leg 32 is designed preferably to be between 0 . 5 and 1 . 0 inches ( 1 . 3 - 2 . 5 cm ). the up leg 26 is designed to extend up and back away from the bowl opening 22 between at an angle θ u 30 and 45 degrees from horizontal . and , the down leg 32 is preferably 40 to 60 degrees from horizontal . the inventors have determined empirically that for the above stated parameters , a dam radius ( r ) of 0 . 8 inches ( 2 cm ), an up leg angle ( θ u ) of 32 . 5 degrees and a down leg angle ( θ d ) of 50 degrees are most preferred . these values are also selected to help develop a flow profile that carries the bulk material over and away form the inner bend of the water dam 28 and into the down leg 32 . the baffle 34 preferably extends a length ( l b ) of between 0 . 5 and 2 . 5 inches ( 1 . 3 - 6 . 4 cm ) at a height ( h b ) of between 1 and 3 . 5 inches ( 2 . 5 - 8 . 9 cm ). the preferred values for these parameters corresponding to those of the other parameters stated above are 1 . 1 inches ( 2 . 8 cm ) and 1 . 2 inch ( 3 . 0 cm ), respectively . these values provide for a sufficient interruption of flow through the down leg 32 so as to build up bulk material therein without closing off the passage excessively . the baffle ledge height and length will vary up or down proportionally to the radius of the down leg . empirical testing has established that a toilet with a trapway of the present invention has improved overall bulk material performance compared to otherwise similar conventional pressure toilets . its improved ability to remove bulk material allows the toilet to operate at very a low flush volume , 1 . 4 gallons ( 5 . 3 liters ) per flush compared to 1 . 6 gallons ( 6 . 1 liters ) per flush in conventional toilets , and at a lower jet velocity , preferably 8 - 10 meters per second ( more preferably 8 . 5 m / s ). thus , the improved toilet consumes less water , operates quieter and handles bulk waste better than conventional pressure toilets . the empirical studies conducted to establish the improved bulk handing of the toilet and trapway of the present invention include pulp pad , pulp ball and paste testing , commonly performed by one or more participants in the industry to test the flush performance of a toilet . the present toilet has shown at least a 15 %, and in some cases a 33 %, improvement in the number of pulp pads ( for example made of multiple sections of multi - ply toilet paper ) able to be evacuated from the bowl in a single flush when compared to conventional pressure toilets . tests of paper ball loading , ( toilet paper crumpled into a ball ) have shown that the present toilet can evacuate on the first flush about 90 % of 50 paper balls and 50 % of 60 paper balls , with the remainder being removed on the second flush and without any plugging of the trapway . such results are not known to have been replicated in conventional pressure toilets . it should be noted that a 50 1 . 5 - 2 inch ( 3 . 8 - 5 . 1 cm ) paper balls of single - ply toilet paper represents roughly a 4 % bulk material concentration . it should be appreciated that a preferred embodiment of the invention has been described above . however , many modifications and variations to the preferred embodiment will be apparent to those skilled in the art , which will be within the spirit and scope of the invention . therefore , the invention should not be limited to the described embodiment . to ascertain the full scope of the invention , the following claims should be referenced . the invention provides a pressure toilet with an improved trapway design allowing the toilet to more effectively flush bulk waste material by establishing siphonic pull in the trapway when sufficient bulk material is present within the trapway .', 'the present invention generally provides a reliable kick over tool for installing devices into and removing devices from a side pocket mandrel , and more

has a frusto - conical shaped outer side surface 31 which tapers outwardly as it extends toward a collar 32 , and a mounting end 34 opposite the work engaging end for mounting the tool on a mining machine . referring now to fig3 the work engaging end 30 of the tool body 28 includes a receptacle 36 shaped for cooperatively receiving and supporting a conventional replaceable cutting insert or tip having a correspondingly shaped base end portion ( not shown ). the present nosepiece 12 mounts in the socket 36 . the only modification to the tool body 28 for the purposes of the present invention is the optional provision of a reduced diameter tapered or frusto - conical outer side surface portion 38 around work engaging end 30 adapted for cooperatively receiving the skirt 14 , which surface portion 38 terminates at a step or shoulder 40 . referring also to fig4 the skirt 14 has an inner annular tapered surface 42 corresponding in size and shape to the tapered surface 38 on the tool body 28 . this enables the skirt 14 to be cooperatively received over work engaging end 30 of the tool body 28 in overlaying relation to the surface 38 , the rear end edge portion 24 of the skirt 14 located in abutting relation to the shoulder 40 on the tool to hold the skirt in position while it is being attached , and to support the skirt during use . this overlaying relation is important as it enables the skirt 14 , which is made of a much harder material than the tool body 28 , to protect the outer side surface of the tool body from erosion and prevents wash - out of the nosepiece 12 . the abutting relation of skirt 14 to shoulder 40 furthermore enables the skirt to more securely support and hold the nosepiece 12 in position . this is especially important to prevent dislodgment of the nosepiece under the immense forces encountered when mining . the skirt 14 includes an inner cylindrical surface portion 44 inwardly from forward end edge 22 , which surface 44 is sized and shaped so as to cooperatively receive and envelope the cylindrical base portion 18 of the nosepiece 12 . the nosepiece 12 and the skirt 14 can be attached to the tool body 28 using any suitable means , a preferred means of attachment being by brazing . one manner of brazing the nosepiece 12 and the skirt 14 to the tool body 28 is by the placement of a conventional brazing disc 46 on the support surface 36 under the nosepiece 12 , and with the skirt 14 in position , heating the thus assembled members to melt the brazing disc 46 whereby the brazing material 48 from the melted disc can flow around the nosepiece 12 and between the surfaces 18 and 44 to bond the nosepiece and the skirt together and to securely attach both the nosepiece and the skirt onto the tool body , as shown in fig5 . additional brazing material ( not shown ) can be added , for instance between the surfaces 38 and 42 , to further strengthen the bond , as desired . the outer work engaging surfaces of the nosepiece 12 and / or the skirt 14 can be provided with a layer of a super hard material such as a material that includes particles of diamond to reduce wear and to enhance the longevity of the assembly 10 . referring to fig6 one preferred diamond layer 50 is formed of a polycrystalline diamond ( pcd ) compact . the layer of pcd compact 50 is a composite including carbide particles or pieces 52 interspersed with diamond crystals 54 which layer is formed by heat and pressure , such as taught in hall et al . u . s . pat . no . 4 , 604 , 106 , and as further explained in my u . s . pat . no . 5 , 161 , 627 . the pcd compact 50 preferably has a percent volume or concentration of carbide which is greatest adjacent to the surface of the tungsten carbide nosepiece 12 and lesser toward the outer surface of the layer , with the outer surface preferably comprised substantially entirely of polycrystalline diamond particles . referring to fig7 an alternative diamond layer 56 is shown . the diamond layer 56 can be thinner than the pcd compact layer 50 shown in fig6 and is representative of diamond particles mixed with a binder plated or otherwise attached to the outer surface of the nosepiece . this can be done using a low temperature , low pressure process such as a low pressure solid state source process for diamond synthesis , or a chemical vapor deposition process . as mentioned above , the nosepiece and skirt members according to the present invention can be made from a variety of different hard materials and can have various shapes for different mining , excavating and other applications . for instance , it has been found that making the nosepiece from one commercially available grade or hardness of carbide material and the skirt from another such as a less hard grade can have advantage for some mining operations . additionally , the skirt according to the present invention can have a variety of different shapes and sizes for different applications . for instance , the skirt 14 has an outer tapered surface angle as measured between the opposite surfaces thereof identified by the letter &# 34 ; a &# 34 ; in fig4 which angle a corresponds to the angle subtended by the opposite portions of the tapered outer surface of the tool body 28 , identified by the letter &# 34 ; b &# 34 ;. the angle &# 34 ; a &# 34 ;, as well as the length of the outer sidewall of the skirt 14 , identified by the letter &# 34 ; x &# 34 ;, and the thickness of the skirt , identified by the letter &# 34 ; y &# 34 ;, can be tailored , so as to provide an expected skirt life corresponding to the expected effective life of a particular nosepiece under certain mining or excavating conditions . in any event , the skirt length x and the skirt thickness y should be selected so as to be sufficient to prevent wash - out of the side of the tool body for a period of operation corresponding to the expected effective life of the nosepiece . as a practical example , a skirt having a length x in a range from about 0 . 200 inch to about 0 . 400 inch or greater and a thickness y of about 0 . 160 inch has been found to provide satisfactory results for some coal mining applications . furthermore , a skirt having an outer surface angle a of about 25 ° corresponding to the outer surface angle b of a variety of conventional coal mining attack tools has been found satisfactory , although other values for this angle could likewise be used . fig8 and 9 show an alternative nosepiece and skirt embodiment 58 which is of one piece or unitary construction . embodiment 58 includes a nosepiece portion 60 having a tip end 62 , a larger opposite rearward end 64 , and an intermediate portion 66 extending between the tip end 62 and opposite rearward end 64 , portions 62 - 66 being round in cross - section and concentric about a central longitudinal axis 68 ( fig9 ). the tip end 62 has an outer surface of rounded shape , and the intermediate portion 66 has an outer surface extending therearound having a concave profile substantially tangent with the round outer shape of tip end 62 and curving progressively outwardly therefrom to the opposite rearward end 64 , the shapes of tip end 62 and intermediate portion 66 providing the same self - sharpening and improved cutting capability of embodiment 10 above . a skirt 70 is located adjacent to the rearward end 64 of the nosepiece 60 and it has a frusto - conical shaped outer surface extending rearwardly and outwardly from a forward end 72 to an opposite rearward end 74 . the outer surface of skirt 70 can have any desired tapered surface angle as measured between the opposite surfaces thereof , the preferred angle corresponding to that of the outer surfaces of a tool body on which the skirt is mounted , in the same manner as explained in reference to fig4 above . referring to fig9 embodiment 58 is shown mounted to an earth engaging end 76 of an attack tool body 78 . earth engaging end 76 of attack tool body 78 is circular in cross - section and includes an endwardly facing generally planar annular shoulder 80 extending around an annular raised lip 82 . the raised lip 82 includes an outer cylindrical side surface 84 extending therearound and surrounds a centrally located endwardly facing receptacle 86 . skirt 70 is mountable to earth engaging end 76 of tool body 78 as shown , rearward end 74 of the skirt being positionable in abutting relation to annular shoulder 80 and including an annular groove 88 adapted for cooperatively receiving lip 82 . groove 88 of the skirt is defined on one side by a cylindrical inner side surface 90 positionable in overlaying relation to the outer side surface 84 of the lip 82 , and on the opposite side by a button 92 correspondingly sized and shaped to be cooperatively received in receptacle 86 . additionally , rearward end edge 74 of the skirt 70 includes a plurality of small bumps 94 at circumferencially spaced locations on the surface of groove 88 , which bumps 94 maintain rearward end edge 74 in predetermined spaced relation to the corresponding surfaces on end 76 of tool body 78 to allow for the penetration of a uniform layer of brazing material 96 therebetween for the attachment of nosepiece and skirt 58 to tool body 78 . when attached in this manner , embodiment 58 is securely locked onto tool body 78 and is less likely to be dislodged therefrom and lost . additionally , the skirt 70 protects the outer sidewall 84 of tool body 78 from erosion and eventual wash - out prior to the end of the expected life of the nosepiece . as a practical example , the embodiment 58 having a skirt portion 70 with a length &# 34 ; d &# 34 ; of about 0 . 500 inch and a thickness &# 34 ; e &# 34 ; of about 0 . 168 inch has been found to provide satisfactory results for some coal mining applications . furthermore , a skirt having an outer surface angle &# 34 ; f &# 34 ; of about 31 ° corresponding to the outer surface angle of the conventional coal mining attack tool shown has been found to be satisfactory , although other values for this angle and the other dimensions recited above can be used . additional dimensions of the embodiment 58 include a forward end 72 of the skirt 70 having a diameter of about 0 . 823 inch , a reward end 74 having a diameter of about 1 . 103 inch , the nosepiece portion 60 having a height of about 0 . 750 inch , concave intermediate portion 66 having a radius of r 1 of about 1 . 232 inch , and tip end 62 with a radius r 2 of 0 . 158 inch , although , again , as in the case of embodiment 10 above , other values for these dimensions could likewise be used . referring again to fig6 and 7 , the outer surface of nosepiece 60 and / or skirt 70 can be provided with a layer of a super hard material such as the diamond layer 50 or the diamond layer 56 , as well as other suitable hardened surfaces . thus there has been shown and described several embodiments of a nosepiece and skirt construction for an attack tool which fulfill all of the objects and advantages sought therefor . many changes , modifications , variations , and other uses and applications of the present construction will , however , become apparent to those skilled in the art after considering this specification and the accompanying drawings . all such changes , modification , variations and other uses and applications which do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention are deemed to be covered by the invention which is limited only by the claims which follow .', 'the system ( 10 ) according to the invention , shown in fig1 is a system for weaving beads ( 20 ). the system ( 10 ) comprises at least one frame ( 30 ) for the implementation of a multiplicity of warp threads ( 40 ) and a needle , which can be connected to a weft thread ( 60 ), such that said beads ( 20 ) can be threaded . the system ( 10 ) comprises means enabling the spacing apart of a multiplicity of warp threads ( 40 ). the frame ( 30 ) presents lateral flanks ( 31 , 32 ) as well as at least one transverse guide ( 33 ) and preferably two transverse guides ( 33 ), composing a succession of cavities and protrusions , with the cavities being intended to receive the warp threads ( 40 ). the frame ( 30 ) also comprises means ( 34 ) for attaching the ends of the warp threads ( 40 ). said beads ( 20 ) are pierced by a hole ( 21 ) through their diameter ( 22 ) and are intended to be threaded on a weft thread ( 60 ). the needle ( 50 ) presents a body comprising at one end an eye ( 51 ) for passage of a weft thread ( 60 ) and at the other end a point ( 52 ), as shown in fig2 . 1 . the needle ( 50 ) comprises means for holding said beads ( 20 ). the point ( 52 ) is preferably slightly conical over approximately 6 millimeters and blunt , so as to make it less dangerous , especially for children ; the eye has a length of at least 2 millimeters so as to facilitate passage of the weft thread ( 60 ). the weft thread ( 60 ) is maintained on the needle ( 50 ) by being threaded in the eye ( 51 ). the beads ( 20 ) are threaded on the needle ( 30 ) via the point ( 52 ) and are then threaded on the weft thread ( 60 ). it is therefore necessary that the outside diameter of the needle ( 50 ) be smaller than the inside diameter of the holes ( 21 ) in the beads ( 20 ). the needle ( 50 ) comprises means for temporarily holding said beads ( 20 ) at least at its point ( 52 ), or over almost the entirety of its surface or in fact over the entirety of its surface . these holding means are designed to cooperate with the inside surface of the holes ( 21 ) in the beads ( 20 ) so as to simplify the stitching of the beads but enabling their retention along the length of the body of the needle without manual intervention . the free diameter of the holding means is between 110 and 200 %, preferably on the order of 140 %, of the average internal diameter of said holes ( 21 ). these holding means can be constituted , for example , by a flocking ( 53 ), i . e ., the gluing on to he surface of the needle of very small viscose fibers or of another fibrous material , with these fibers being oriented essentially perpendicular to the axis of the needle as shown in fig2 . 2 . the holding means can also be constituted , for example , by a multiplicity of longitudinal , transverse or helicoid strips ( 55 ). when the strips ( 55 ) are longitudinal , as shown in fig2 . 3 , they create a sort of feathering . when they are essentially concentric with the body of the needle ( 50 ) and when they are helicoid , they create a sort of screw thread . these holding means can also be constituted , for example , by a multiplicity of cylindrical barbs ( 54 ) as shown in fig2 . 4 . these semirigid barbs ( 54 ) can be created by molding material which is attached on to the body of the needle ( 50 ) or injected simultaneously upon creation of the body of the needle by injection of plastic . in one version of the invention , the system ( 10 ) moreover comprises at least one bead - support device ( 70 ) constituted by a baseplate ( 71 ) intended to be positioned under the warp threads ( 40 ) so as to enable maintaining said beads ( 20 ) during the forward weaving and return weaving of said weft thread ( 60 ) transversely to said warp threads ( 40 ) as shown successively in fig5 . 1 to 5 . 5 this device is intended to stain the beads ( 20 ) aligned between the warp threads ( 50 ) for weaving the weft thread ( 60 ) in one transverse direction as shown in fig5 . 1 and 5 . 2 , and then in the other transverse direction as shown in fig5 . 3 to 5 . 5 . the baseplate ( 71 ) presents means for the regular spacing apart of said warp threads ( 40 ) constituted , for example , by a multiplicity of regularly spaced apart cavities ( 72 ) in which can be positioned the free parts of the warp threads ( 40 ) as shown in fires 3 . 1 , 3 . 2 and 3 . 3 . the baseplate ( 71 ) also has a return end ( 73 ) as shown in fig3 . 4 . thus , in order to position the needle ( 50 ) carrying the beads ( 20 ) and linked to the weft thread ( 60 ), it is necessary to slightly raise the warp threads ( 40 ) so as to be able to slide the needle ( 50 ) beneath them as shown in fig5 . 1 , the baseplate ( 71 ) comprises means enabling suspension of the bead - support device ( 70 ) on said warp threads ( 40 ) constituted , for example , by a band of material ( 74 ) that can be positioned across said warp threads ( 40 ) as shown in fig3 . 5 . thus , the bead - support device ( 70 ) is removable . the bead - support device ( 70 ) can also be completely integrated in the frame ( 30 ) or totally separate from the frame ( 30 ). the bead - support device ( 70 ) is preferably positioned downstream of the work in progress . the base ( 71 ) of the bead - support device ( 70 ) presents at least partially an unsmooth surface ( 75 ) made , for example , by flocking or constituted of felt so as to prevent the beads ( 20 ) from rolling . in one version of the invention the system ( 10 ) moreover comprises a storage device ( 80 ) of the type comprising at least one bin ( 81 ) presenting a bottom wall ( 82 ), a top wall ( 83 ) and side walls ( 84 ) as shown in elevation in fig4 . 1 and in side view in fig4 . 2 . the bin ( 81 ) comprises at least one opening ( 85 ) in a side wall ( 84 ) and opening onto a receiving tray ( 86 ) comprising rims ( 87 ) to make available the at least partial content of said bin ( 81 ) and to concentrate the reentering flow when storing in the interior of said bin ( 81 ). the receiving tray ( 86 ) is positioned in the extension of the bottom wall ( 82 ). the receiving tray ( 86 ) thus facilitates both the filling and the extraction of the contents of said bin ( 81 ). the receiving tray ( 86 ) comprises an unsmooth covering made , for example , by flocking or constituted of felt so as to facilitate the stitching of the beads ( 20 ) and their threading on the needle ( 50 ) as shown in fig4 . 6 . in fact , said unsmooth covering facilitates the positioning of the beads such that the axes of their holes are perpendicular to the receiving tray ( 86 ). the opening ( 85 ) is fitted with a closing means . said bins ( 81 ) are arranged in pairs and each pair of bins ( 81 ) is equipped with a single receiving tray ( 86 ) and a single shutter ( 88 ) which can be moved between a position in which the first opening ( 85 ) is free , shown in fig4 . 5 , a position in which both openings ( 85 ) are blocked , shown in fig4 . 4 , and a position in which the second opening ( 85 ) is free , not illustrated . the shutter ( 88 ) separates said receiving tray ( 86 ) into two compartments . this shutter ( 88 ) can present the form of a rigid hammer whose handle is mounted in a mobile manner on a shaft ( 89 ) as shown in fig4 . 1 . thus , to discharge beads ( 20 ) stored in a bin ( 81 ), it is sufficient to move the shutter ( 88 ) on its shaft ( 89 ) so as to unblock the opening ( 85 ), then slide out the beads ( 20 ) onto the receiving tray ( 86 ) and then return the shutter ( 88 ) to its initial position . means of the spring type can be provided such that this return to the initial position is automatic . in order to store the beads ( 20 ) in their bins ( 81 ), it is sufficient to move the shutter ( 88 ) in the opposite direction and to slide the beads to the opening ( 85 ) or to tilt up the storage device ( 80 ). the shutter ( 87 ) can also present the form of a flexible , deformable hammer , which is displaced in an essentially similar manner . the bins ( 81 ) preferably comprise colored markers or transparent windows so that the color of the beads stored within can be determined . the storage device ( 80 ) can preferably be attached to the frame ( 30 ) by means , for example , of clips ( 90 ) as shown in fig4 . 1 and 4 . 3 . the storage device ( 80 ) is preferably made by injection of plastic . the bottom ( 82 ) of the bin ( 81 ), the receiving tray ( 86 ) and the shaft ( 89 ) form a first part and the remainder of the storage device ( 80 ), i . e ., the top wall ( 83 ) and the side walls ( 84 ) of the bin ( 81 ), as well as the shutter ( 88 ) and the rims ( 87 ) of the receiving tray ( 86 ) form a second part . the invention is described above as an example . it is understood that the expert in the field could implement different variants of the invention without departing from the scope of the patent .', 'in the said figures , the reference numeral 20 indicates a traditional bobbin provided with flanges 22 , while 10 indicates a bobbin which is conical at its upper end 16 and lower end 17 . the reference numeral 30 indicate the support spindles for the bobbins 10 , 20 , and 25 indicates a thread about which the thread 15 is wound in spiral form . the thread 15 is wound on the bobbin 10 , 20 by a winding machine . this operation has to be carried our with particular care in the case of bobbins 20 with flanges 22 so that there are no accumulations or shortages of thread 15 close to the flanged ends , and that the winding is perfectly uniform on the spindle 30 . this is made necessary by tie fact that a poorly uniform winding demonstrates poor unwinding characteristics during the subsequent spiralling to which it is subjected . in this respect , if the thread 15 has not been uniformly wound along the entire spindle 30 , it could be squashed below the flanges 22 , which project beyond the level of the winding , in correspondence with the regions 27 in which the thread 15 is subjected to an upward traction force and sudden folding towards the outside of the bobbin 20 . in contrast , if conical bobbins 10 are used , the operator does not have to manually check the arrangement of the thread 15 along the entire spindle 30 during winding as the thread 15 does not come into contact with the flanges 22 , which can be of reduced dimensions ( in this respect see the bobbin 10 of fig2 ) and provided only to facilitate manipulation of the bobbin 10 . during spiralling , the thread can unwind following a trajectory much more linear than in the preceding case . to have an immediate idea of the difference , compare the unwinding directions of the thread 15 for traditional bobbins 20 ( fig1 ) and for double - cones bobbins 10 ( fig2 ). to maintain shape during its winding on the spindle 30 without the aid of retaining flanges 22 , the thread 15 is wound by winding machines with large turn pitches and high rotational speeds both of the bobbin 10 and of the thread guide . in this case the growth of the thread 15 is automatically centered , and the bobbins 10 can be freely changed on the winding machines without having to subject them to preliminary manual adjustment to centre the package of thread 15 relative to the flanges 22 . the bobbin 10 prepared in this manner is then ready for mounting on the spiralling machine and be subjected to the desired handling . using bobbins 20 with flanges 22 in spiralling machines also presents further problems which are obviated by the use of conical bobbins and preferably of double - cone bobbins . firstly , because the bobbins rotate at very high speed ( 20 , 000 - 25 , 000 r . p . m .) during the unwinding of the thread 15 , the presence of flanges 22 having a diameter equal to the maximum dimension of the bobbin 20 results in the movement of large air masses , increasing energy consumption . in this respect , with bobbins 10 , 20 full of thread 15 the energy consumption is virtually the same whether bobbins 20 with flanges 22 or conical bobbins 10 with reduced - size flanges 22 are used , however as the thread 15 gradually unwinds from the bobbin 10 , 20 and winds onto the thread support 25 electrical energy consumption decreases if conical or double - cone bobbin 10 are used , where it remain sudstantially unchanged in the case of flanged bobbins 20 . this saving in energy consumption is particularly evident in handling large thread quantities wound on a large number of bobbins . in this respect , it is not unusual for spiralling operations to involve in one and the same plant up to 100 , 000 rotating bobbins operating simultaneously . the use of bobbins 10 without flanges 22 or with flanges having a size less than the maximum diameter of the winding also reduces vibration of the spiralling machine and the total weight of the structure . in such a case , the actual weight of the flanges 22 can be converted into extra thread 15 ( compared with known methods ) wound on the conical bobbin 10 . the result is that for equal loads acting on the spiralling machine bearings , if conical bobbins 10 are used the useful product yarn obtained is greater than the product obtained using flanged bobbins . furthermore , even minimum mechanical deformation of the flanges 22 ( due to possible structural defects , constructional errors or impact during use ) would cause unbalance during rotation of the spindle 30 which , because of the high speeds concerned , would result in drastic reduction in the average life of the ball bearings . moreover the of conical or double - cone bobbins 10 in spiralling processes enable the spiralling machines to be of more simple construction than the known art , using a minimum quantity of components and hence limiting the manufacturing and operational costs . in this respect , the construction of a bobbin 10 without flanges 22 or with flanges 22 of reduced dimensions is simpler and less costly than a traditional bobbin 10 . the characteristics of the method for handling threads in spiralling machines and of the spiralling machine of the present invention are apparent from the a foregoing description , as are their advantages . less time lost due to spindle stoppages deriving from faults or malfunction during spiralling , compared with the known art ; lesser manufacturing and running costs of the spiralling machine compared with the known art . it is apparent that modifications can be made to the thread handling method and spiralling machine of the present invention without thereby leaving the novel principles of the inventive idea , it being further apparent that in the practical implementation of the product deriving from the new method the materials , forms and dimensions of the illustrated details can be chosen according to requirements and can be replaced by others technically equivalent .', 'please refer to fig1 ,

repulper 6 , a classifier 7 of large components , a diluting tank 8 , a pump 9 , a first - stage fractionizer 10 , a second - stage fractionizer 27 , a thickener 28 of the short fiber fraction , a thickener 11 of the long fiber fraction , an activizer 12 , a mixing tank 13 , a mixing pump 14 , a screen classifier 15 , a two - stage groove classifier composed of a first - stage groove or slit classifier 16 and a second - stage groove or slit classifier 29 , a final vibrating screen 30 , an inlet tank 17 , an inlet pump 18 , a first stage of centrifugal separators 19 , a thickener 26 of the long fraction , a throughflow tank 20 , a throughflow pump 21 , a second - stage centrifugal separator 22 , an outlet tank 23 , an outflow pump 24 , and a third stage of centrifugal separators 25 . the fractionizers 12 and 27 , the activizer 12 , the screen classifier 15 , and the groove or slit classifiers 16 and 29 have the structures and manners of operation described above . the arrangement according to this invention operates so that low - grade waste paper is dosed into the pulper 1 , where it is shredded so that suspension of its fibers passes through the fine perforations of the extraction plate 2 of the pulper 1 and is collected in the diluting tank 3 , which is pumped by the pump 4 to the classifier 5 of heavy components and through the repulper 6 to the classifier 7 of large components . the suspension of finely fiberized waste paper , deprived of coarse contaminations , is furthermore supplied to the diluting tank 8 where its consistency is adjusted to a value required for fractionizing . the suspension is then forwarded by a pump 9 to the first - stage fractionizer 10 where unrequired very fine fractions and broken fibers are removed . the long fibers are supplied to the thickener 11 where the unnecessary part of water is removed from the suspension prior to its supply to the activizer 12 . the thickened long fiber material is exposed in the activizer to the influence of kneading means which subject the surfaces of the fiber to a mutual friction thereby improving their bonding activity . after passage through the activizer , the long fiber fraction is diluted and its concentration is reduced in a mixing tank 13 , and is then pumped by a mixing pump 14 to the screen classifier 15 , where it is deprived of the finest unpulped fractions and of parts of foils of plastic material . the suspension of the long fiber fraction is thereafter supplied to the first - stage and then to the second - stage of the groove classifier 16 , 29 , where it is deprived of fiber packs , particles of foam polystyrene , and of larger point - shaped contaminations . the thus preliminarily classified suspension of the long fiber fraction is finally classified on

conduit 22a . as the arrangement according to this invention is composed of currently manufactured components with the exception of the fractionizers in a novel combination securing its novel effect , its realization is possible with low investment costs in any plant processing collected low - grade waste paper . although the invention is illustrated and described with reference to one preferred embodiment thereof , it is to be expressly understood that it is in no way limited to the disclosure of such preferred embodiment but is capable of numerous modifications within the scope of the appended claims .', 'in order to enhance understanding of the invention applicants have elected to describe briefly the components of the tool followed by a discussion of its operation . referring to fig1 , a pump jack 10 is illustrated schematically . one of skill in the art will recognize a walking beam 12 and sucker rod 14 extending into a wellbore 16 . the pump jack 10 as is known , reciprocates the sucker rod up and down in the wellbore . the sucker rod 14 of the pump jack is the only portion of the pump jack that is modified in connection with the invention and therefore other components of the pump jack need not be described in detail . also to be noted is that although a pump jack is utilized herein as a source of movement , other sources of similar movement could be substituted while maintaining the benefits of the inventive concept . referring to fig2 , a power generation arrangement 20 for use in combination with a reciprocating source such as a pump jack is illustrated . the arrangement includes a housing 22 , within which is disposed at least one piezoelectric component 24 which may be a single piezoelectric element or a plurality of elements in a stack . the component 24 is in physical force transmission contact with a resilient member ( stress inducer ) 26 , illustrated as a coil spring , but could be any device similarly capable of oscillatory movement . spring 26 is in operable communication with a magnetic element 28 , which may be a rare earth magnet or may simply be a ferrous element . the magnetic element 28 is also in operable communication with another resilient member 30 ( also illustrated as a coil spring for convenience but as noted for spring 26 , other devices capable of oscillatory movement are equally applicable ). spring 30 may be the same or different from spring 26 , providing that the desired oscillatory motion of magnetic element 28 and associated mechanical compression of component 24 is preserved . spring 30 is bounded by a compression cap 32 in the illustrated embodiment but could alternatively be bounded by another piezoelectric component ( not shown ) that essentially would be a mirror image of the component 24 . in such an arrangement , power generation would occur based upon movement of the magnetic element 28 in both axial directions . through an inside dimension of all of the foregoing components is at least one sucker rod 14 or sucker rod extension 34 having at least one magnetic element 36 disposed thereat . magnetic element 36 may be a magnet or simply a ferrous element providing that either it or the magnetic element 28 is in fact a magnet . at least one of the two magnetic elements 28 and 36 must provide a magnetic field for operability of the invention . it is to be noted that the sucker rod 34 is used in an exemplary manner and is not a limitation of the invention . any support for the magnetic element 36 that is an oscillatory structure itself is substitutable . magnetic element 36 , if indeed a magnet , is to be attractively polarized relative to magnetic element 28 such that a strong attractive force is generated between the magnetic elements . further noted is that at portions of the sucker rod 34 other than at the at least one magnetic element 36 , there is disposed a non - magnetic sleeve 38 . sleeve 38 that functions to align the magnetic elements and the sucker rod to ensure that they remain non - contacting in nature thereby reducing frictional losses otherwise caused by magnetic attraction of the magnetic element 28 to the sucker rod 34 , which is usually a metal , or actual contact between magnetic elements 28 and 36 . as one of skill in the art should recognize the sucker rod 34 moves up and down pursuant to the motion of the walking beam pictured in fig1 . this movement is harnessed as taught herein not only for its original purpose of pumping stubborn well fluids to the surface but to generate power for downhole devices as well . referring to fig2 - 6 as a sequence of drawings showing the device in different positions , the operation thereof will become clearer . as magnetic element 36 draws nearer magnetic element 28 the attractive magnetic fields they exhibit ( or one field attracting the ferrous element of the other ) begin to draw magnetic element 28 toward magnetic element 36 , to some extent overcoming spring 26 in compression and spring 30 in tension . this movement of magnetic element 28 will impart a compressive load , through spring 26 to component 24 thereby creating an electrical potential in component 24 . since the magnetic element 36 is moving towards magnetic element 28 , it should be understood that the magnitude of the compressive load on the component 24 for this movement is small and consequently the potential generated is small . as the sucker rod continues , its movement uphole and as illustrated in fig3 , the magnetic elements 28 and 36 align and thereby are at the highest attractive force therebetween . yet farther uphole movement of sucker rod 34 draws magnetic element 28 to compress spring 30 while extending spring 28 . this continues , since the magnetic elements are engineered to have a greater attractive force to each other than the springs 26 and 30 have spring force to separate them , until the spring 30 is substantially maximally compressed . after such compression , illustrated in fig4 , magnetic element 36 is moved farther uphole with sucker rod 34 thereby misaligning the magnetic elements and thus reducing the attractive forces therebetween . at a point , the attractive force between magnetic element 28 and magnetic element 36 is overcome by the spring force of springs 30 and 26 . as this occurs , springs 30 and 26 propel magnetic element 28 back toward component 24 as illustrated in fig6 . this motion , as one of skill in the art should appreciate , presents a relatively large compressive load on the component 24 thereby generating a large electrical potential . further , because of the springs of 30 and 26 , the magnetic element 28 will oscillate causing a number of compressions on the component 24 , each developing an electrical potential . since the oscillations diminish in magnitude with each cycle , the compressive load is also reduced but some of the benefit is still achieved by oscillatory motion until magnetic element 28 is magnetically “ bound ” again to magnetic element 36 ( or another similar magnetic element if the sucker rod stroke is long enough to create multiple actuations due to magnetic interaction using multiple magnetic elements 36 ). a capacitor 40 is electrically connected to the piezoelectric component 24 to store the potential generated by the disclosed system for use when needed . as was noted hereinabove , a pump jack is but one source of movement for a system such as that disclosed . further , and also as noted , in an alternative embodiment , compression cap 32 could be substituted by an additional piezoelectric component so that oscillatory compressive loading on both springs 30 and 26 will produce potentials . this will increase available power downhole from the system as described . in addition hereto , rapid unloading of the component 24 will create a voltage as well . this voltage may be made usable by employing a rectifier bridge 42 in the electrical circuit connected to the component 24 . while preferred embodiments have been shown and described , modifications and substitutions may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention . accordingly , it is to be understood that the present invention has been described by way of illustrations and not limitation .', 'the washer chamber 1 shown in fig1 comprises a tub 2 arranged on the base 6 . a fan 3 for incoming air is arranged outside the washer chamber 1 on one lateral wall . rectifier profiles 3a for the incoming air supplied by the fan 3 are arranged on the side of the lateral wall of the washer chamber 1 facing the fan 3 . drainage profiles 4 are arranged on an outlet side with the lower end projecting into the tub 2 . on the base 6 of the tub 2 , a suction device 5 is arranged movably over the base 6 of the tub 2 . the suction device 5 preferably covers a cross section of the tub 2 and is preferably arranged so that the suction device 5 can move to and from parallel to the rectifier profiles 3a and the drainage profiles 4 in the tub 2 , as indicated by the double arrow in fig2 . a brush unit 7 is arranged inside the washer chamber 1 in such a way that bristles of the brush unit 7 can enter the entry region of the drainage profiles 4 , the drainage profiles 4 being mechanically cleaned of deposits during up and down movement of the brush unit 7 . the brush unit 7 can comprise rigidly arranged brushes with rigid bristles and / or also a brush roller with flexible and / or rigid bristles . spray nozzles 8 are arranged in the washer chamber 1 between the front and rear end face , distributed over the height in the lateral walls and directed towards one another in a plane , as shown in fig2 . the spray nozzles 8 are connected via a piping system 9 to a pump 10 of which the suction nozzle 11 opens in a lateral or end wall of the tub 2 , beneath the always present level of liquid 12 in the tub 2 . a preferably exchangeable filter 13 can be arranged in front of or behind the pump 10 in the suction nozzle 11 or in the piping system 9 . in one preferred embodiment , the filter 13 is arranged in the straight part of a diverting elbow , as shown in fig2 . thus a rapid exchange of a circular filter adapted to the pipe diameter can be achieved by opening the lid , removing the circular filter , and optionally flushing thereof and reinsertion or insertion of a new filter into the path of flow and re - closure of the lid . the suction device 5 can be connected by a flexible suction pipe 14 to a conventional filter plant , not shown , which contains a delivery pipe 15 for recirculating the cleaned liquid , such as water , in addition to a filter 41 , valves and pumps 40 . the filter plant can be so designed that the filter 13 is exchangeable and backwashable and comprises nozzles for drainage and silt removal , wherein valves , for example solenoid valves , controlled via time clocks can also perform an operating program , which is predetermined or is controlled on the basis of test parameters automatically and / or with interposition of sensors . as a filter plant of this type and developments thereof is widely known , they are not described in this specification . the cleaned liquid can be recirculated to the tub 2 by means of the delivery pipe 15 of the filter plant . as already mentioned , the suction device 5 should be movable to and from within the tub 2 . the water pressure supplied through the delivery pipe 15 from the pressure plant can preferably be used for this purpose . thus , the suction device 5 contains a central pressure chamber 16 , as shown in fig3 and in fig5 in which a water wheel 18 is arranged rotatably on an axis of rotation 17 or about a stationary axis . the delivery pipe 15 passes into a nozzle 19 which ends in two separate passages 20 , 21 into the pressure chamber 16 arranged symmetrically with respect to the central axis za , as shown in fig5 at a distance . the passages 20 , 21 are preceded by a two - way valve 22 which selectively seals one of the two passages and opens the other or vice versa . roughly in the 90 ° to 130 ° range and in the 230 ° to 270 ° range of the cross section the central pressure chamber 16 comprises longitudinal slots 23 with flaps 24 , the flaps 24 being arranged movably in such a way that the flaps 24 close with flow against from above and open with flow against from below , as shown by the blackened arrow heads in fig5 . in the embodiment according to fig3 and fig5 the axis 17 or the water wheel 18 is coupled to a displacement means comprising belts , preferably two mutually spaced toothed belts 25 , only one of which is shown in the partial section in fig3 . the toothed belts 25 are guided by return rollers or return toothed wheels 27 mounted rotatably on the housing of the suction device 5 preferably at the end of extension arms 26 and can also be guided at least via a support roller or a support gearwheel 28 in the intermediate region . the toothed belt 25 can preferably also have teeth on both sides to increase the friction on the base 6 of the tub 2 . with a design of this type , inclinations of the base and small steps pose no problems . brushes 29 , as shown in fig3 which are stationary and / or rotate and / or perform up and down and / or to and from movements and contact the base 6 of the tub 2 are positioned between and to the side of the displacement means . to compensate wear , the brushes 29 can be adjustable and can optionally also be driven , preferably via a clutch with the drive of the displacement means , optionally with interposition of a gear for varying the speed of movement or the speed of rotation or the frequency of the proposed rotational and / or to and from movements of the brushes 29 . rotating brushes can also be used as displacement means . suction chambers 30 , with a suction chamber on only one side , which communicate with the connecting nozzles 32 of the suction pipe 14 via a duct 31 arranged above the central chamber 16 are arranged , in particular , on either side of the central pressure chamber 16 . in the direction of the base 6 of the tub 2 , the suction chambers 30 have intake orifices 33 in the vicinity of the brushes 29 , as shown in fig4 . at least one duct 34 , as shown in fig4 which is connected at each end to the suction chambers 30 can also be provided beneath the central pressure chamber 16 . the ducts 34 can have slot - shaped and / or annular intake apertures 33 &# 39 ;. as mentioned , the suction device 5 should preferably be designed so as to cover a cross section of the tub 2 , preferably with the smallest dimensions . this can optionally be achieved with lateral projections or extension arms , not shown in the drawings , which should then also carry stationary or moving brushes . to guarantee directed movement and to prevent tilting of the suction device 5 during its longitudinal movements within the tub 2 , the suction device 5 can be designed with a guide system which also includes arrangements in the lateral walls of the washer chamber 1 . fig3 illustrates a possible guide system 36 of this type which comprises two spaced guide rollers 37 , only one of which is shown in the drawings , on each end face of the suction device 5 and one respective guide rail 38 formed in the lateral walls of the tub 2 , preferably above the water level 12 , and brush devices can also be provided for cleaning the guide rails 38 , not shown in the drawings . any other desired known guide can also be used , for example also a remotely controlled system which allows the base aspirator any free or predetermined movement over the base , this being useful , in particular with relatively large tubs , where it would be difficult or impossible to handle a base aspirator covering a cross section . if the cross section of a tub 2 is somewhat greater , several suction devices 5 can also be arranged side by side and can be coupled to one another in use . each of the suction devices 5 can be virtually identical in construction and can be mutually coupled mechanically . however , it is also possible to arrange , in particular , smaller modules at each end of the suction device 5 , wherein the drive of the water wheel 18 can be transmitted to the secondary modules via a clutch to the rotatable axis 17 . a flexible connecting pipe can optionally connect the suction chamber 30 to corresponding chambers of the secondary modules . this can also be effected by a direct connection via a closable orifice 39 , as shown in fig3 in the suction chamber 30 . the device according to this invention for the cleaning of tubs operates as follows . with a suction device 5 arranged on the base of the tub 2 and designed in accordance with the foregoing description , cleaned liquid , such as water , is supplied through the delivery pipe 15 into the suction device 5 . water under pressure is supplied to the blades of the water wheel 18 to the side of the central axis za , depending on the position of the two - way valve 22 . the water wheel 18 is therefore set into rotation and the flow of water indicated by closed arrows in fig5 is achieved . this flow closes the flaps 24 of the slots 23 as it descends , so a closed wall is formed . during further movement to the opposite side , the same stream opens the flaps 24 of the slots 23 in the range of the 230 ° to 270 ° position so that the stream of water under pressure issues from the housing and the pressure is reduced . the displacement means , at least two toothed belts 25 arranged at a distance from one another in this case , is also moved by the rotational movement of the water wheel and , with the direction of flow illustrated by the arrows in fig5 the suction device 5 moves to the right as shown in fig5 . this movement is assisted by the discharge of the stream of water under pressure through the opened flaps 24 of the slots 23 . if the suction device 5 driven in this way reaches one end face of the tub 2 , a limit switch , not shown , on the suction device 5 in contact with the end wall actuates the two - way valve 22 so that the passage 21 is closed and the passage 20 is opened so that a fresh supply of the stream of water under pressure in the direction of the open arrow in fig5 causes a reversal of the direction of movement of the water wheel 18 , and a reversal of movement is also achieved . the same applies on attainment of the other end face of the tub 2 . the suction device 5 therefore moves automatically over the entire base of the tub 2 , moving continuously to and from , and keeps the tub 2 free from deposits caused by the aspiration and the mechanical cleaning by the brushes . the speed of movement can be influenced by changing the water pressure supplied , optionally also by controllable flow control valves . the base 6 of the tub 2 is continuously treated mechanically by the brushes 29 so deposits are unable to settle on the base 6 of the tub 2 . falling particles are swirled from the base 6 so the falling particles can be grasped particularly easily by the suction stream . the particularly endangered edge regions are aspirated more intensively by the arrangement of the suction chambers at the ends of the apparatus , so deposits are more strictly prevented at critical edge regions . since there is virtually only cleaned liquid , such as water , in the tub 2 , the shelf lives of the spray nozzles 8 in the washer chamber 1 , which are also arranged laterally with protection , are invariably charged with cleaned water so deposits cannot form either internally or externally . for this reason , it is not essential to provide a filter in the supply pipe , let alone at the outlet of the suction nozzle where a filter is arranged in conventional devices . the use of a filter which can be exchanged , in particular , in the manner described above additionally increases the shelf lives of the spray nozzles 8 . the brush unit 7 which can be displaced up and down cleans the drainage profiles 4 in their inlet region which is particularly endangered by deposits , so the shelf life thereof is also extended considerably prior to general cleaning . to sum up , the characteristics according to this invention allow continuous cleaning of inorganic and / or organic deposits from the tub 2 and allow the shelf lives of devices containing the subject of this invention to be substantially extended .', 'referring to fig1 , a window sill flashing ( hereinafter referred to as “ flashing ”) 10 is generally shown according to an embodiment of the present invention . the flashing 10 is formed to fit within and snugly conform to a bottom portion 12 of a window opening 14 of a wall 15 . window opening 14 has a width w and is adapted to accept a window assembly 13 . as illustrated , the face portion ( or flange ) 22 of flashing 10 is generally u - shaped and constructed as one piece . the flashing 10 comprises a base 16 , a first side flange 18 integrally formed with base 16 at one end , a second side flange 20 integrally formed with base 16 at an opposite end , and a front flange 22 integrally formed with base 16 . preferably base 16 , side flanges 18 , 20 and front flange 22 are all vacuum formed from , a common sheet . front ( u - shaped ) flange 22 extends perpendicularly downward from an edge of base 16 . first side flange 18 includes a front surface 18 a and second side flange 20 includes a front surface 20 a . the flashing 10 is glued , calked , taped , or otherwise permanently secured within window opening 14 . it is contemplated that flashing 10 of fig1 is formed in various standard size lengths and widths to accommodate various standard window openings 14 and wall thicknesses . fig2 and 3 illustrate a first alternative embodiment of the flashing of fig1 , wherein like features are indicated by the same reference number . flashing 10 a is fabricated as two separate portions 10 a ′ and 10 a ″. portions 10 a ′ and 10 a ″ form the left and right side of flashing 10 . alternatively , flashing 10 a is fabricated as a one piece member with a length ( prior to cutting ) that spans beyond the width w of window opening 14 . prior to installation of flashing 10 a into window opening 14 , flashing 10 a is cut , resulting in portions of flashings 10 a ′ and 10 a ″. it can be appreciated that flashing 10 a may be cut at any point along its length , so long as flashings 10 a ′ and 10 a ″ fit within window opening 14 . thereafter , portions 10 a ′ and 10 a ″ are placed so that they partially overlap one another in a region 24 producing flashing 10 a having length l that is generally equal to the width w of window opening 14 . fig3 is a cross - sectional view of the overlap region 24 of portions 10 a ′ and 10 a ″. one advantage of flashing 10 a is that flashing 10 a may be cut to size in the field to accommodate any width w of window opening 14 . fig4 and 5 illustrate a further alternate embodiment of the flashing of the present invention . flashing 10 b is similar to flashing 10 and flashing 10 a , except portions of flashing 10 b ′ and 10 b ″ do not overlap at region 24 , instead , portions 10 b ′ and 10 b ″ are separated by a gap 26 . as illustrated , gap 26 is narrow relative to the width w of window opening 14 . however , it can be appreciated that gap 26 may be any desired length . for instance , gap 26 may expose a substantial portion of width w of window opening 14 . further , gap 26 may be optionally covered with a sill flashing cap 28 . fig6 and 7 illustrate a further embodiment of the flashing of the present invention . flashing 10 c is substantially similar to flashing 10 a ; however , flashing 10 c includes a rear , vertical rising wall 30 to further impede the ingress of water . rear , vertical rising wall 30 is located along an edge of base 16 , opposite of front flange 22 and extends perpendicularly upward from base 16 . fig8 and 9 illustrate yet another embodiment of the flashing of the present invention . flashing 10 d is substantially similar to flashing 10 b ; however , flashing 10 b includes rear , vertical rising wall 30 . fig1 - 14 illustrate the steps for installing flashing 10 within window opening 14 . initially , the window opening 14 is covered with housewrap 32 . mousewrap 32 is then cut along perforated lines 34 . perforated lines 34 divide housewrap 32 into upper section 32 a , lower section 32 b , left side 32 c and right side 32 d . the lower section 32 b and left and right sides 32 c , 32 d of housewrap 32 are folded inwardly , towards the interior surface of wall 15 . upper section 32 a is rolled up towards the exterior of wall 15 , in the direction of arrows a ( see fig1 ). thereafter , flashing 10 or portions of flashing 10 a ″, 10 b ″, 10 c ″ or 10 d ″ are placed on top of bottom portion 12 of window opening 14 ( see fig1 ). fig1 illustrate flashing portions 10 a ′, 10 b ′, 10 c ′, or 10 d ′ being placed along bottom portion 12 . finally , flashing 10 is secured to bottom portion 12 . fig1 illustrates flashing 10 being secured to bottom portion 12 with adhesive tape 36 . adhesive tape 36 is also used to seal the seam created by the overlap 24 between right and left portions of the flashing 10 . where there is no overlap 24 , adhesive tape 36 may be used to cover the bottom portion 12 of window opening 14 . thereafter , a window 13 is installed within window opening 14 . the flashing 10 of the present invention is preferably manufactured from sheets of thermoforming film , such as a rigid homopolymer vinyl film , or polyvinyl chloride ( pvc ), or the like . the preferable material properties for flashing 10 are listed in the table below : property units value gauge range mils 7 . 5 - 35 gauge tolerance % ± 5 specific gravity — 1 . 33 material yield ( nominal ) in . 2 / lb . 2770 ( 7 . 5 mil ) 2080 ( 10 . 0 mil ) 1390 ( 15 . 0 mil ) 1040 ( 20 . 0 mil ) tensile strength ( yield ) lb ./ in . 2 6600 elongation ( break ) % 180 tensile impact strength ft - lb ./ in . 2 275 cold break temperature ° c . − 30 heat deflection temperature at 264 psi ° f . 162 gloss % 115 it can be appreciated that the flashing 10 may be covered with a silicone coating for ease of manufacturing and separation of the flashing 10 and for ease in installation of window assembly 13 . flashing 10 is preferably fabricated using vacuum forming techniques . vacuum forming flashing 10 from thin gage material allows the first and second side flanges 18 , 20 to be substantially perpendicular to base 16 . the material properties , including the material thickness , provides flexibility to flashing 10 , thus allowing the vacuum forming dies to separate from the flashing 10 once the vacuum forming process is completed . additionally , vacuum forming flashing 10 allows the material to have a minimum thickness ( as thin as 7 . 5 mm ). therefore , when portions of flashing 10 overlap , the resultant gap under the flashing 10 is minimal and does not allow water intrusions . due to the geometry and thinness of flashing 10 , flashing 10 cannot he manufactured using an injection molding process . if flashing 10 were to be manufactured by injection molding , the minimum thickness feasible for flashing 10 is 40 mm , significantly higher than the practical thickness of flashing 10 formed by the vacuum forming process . moreover , to maintain the perpendicularity of surfaces 16 , 18 , 20 and 22 over the depth of base 16 , flashing 10 would require ribs , or support struts , to be molded into base 16 . these ribs would detract from the functionality of flashing 10 . furthermore , it would be necessary to include ports along base 16 to ensure that sufficient material flows across and covers the entire base 16 . these ports would give rise to dimples , or other imperfections in the surface of base 16 . the imperfections could create gaps or openings along the window sill , thereby comprising the water impermeability of flashing 10 . even with the use of ports along base 16 , obtaining complete flow coverage of injected material is problematic because the preferred depth of base 1 is in the range of 1 inches to 3¼ inches . the embodiments disclosed herein have been discussed for the purpose of familiarizing the reader with novel aspects of the invention . although preferred embodiments of the invention have been shown and described , many changes , modifications and substitutions may be made by one having ordinary skill in the art without necessarily departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as described in the following claims .', 'brief description of the modular design roof deck and patio apparatus the present invention relates to a modular design roof , deck and patio

be placed onto the bottom of the base 210 prior to filling with the growing medium to prevent root growth into and through the drain hole 410 and onto the roof , deck or patio surface below the base 200 . as will be apparent , alternate base and modular panel embodiments , adapted for filling with a growing medium and plant life , and including alternate construction and connection means details , are also suitable for use in the green roof , deck or patio apparatus of the present invention as contemplated herein . accordingly , a green roof , deck or patio apparatus can be quickly and easily installed with the use of such bases and modular panel system by covering the roof , deck or patio surface , or the desired portion of the roof , deck or patio surface , with panels in side by side or design configuration layouts , the base and panel system being filled with desired growing materials . as illustrated in fig6 , in preferred embodiments , the bases 200 are provided for releasably connecting together . such an arrangement is useful in providing a cohesive , wind resistant , non - shiftable green roof , deck and patio apparatus 100 , and is particularly useful in connection with shallow , relatively light bases 200 to prevent high wind from lifting the bases 200 from the roof , deck or patio surface . in carrying out this aspect of the invention , in the embodiments shown , two bases 200 can be connected together by snap connection means with a water shed / connector 710 , modular panels 230 and corner interlocking - posts 240 , as illustrated in fig6 and 7 . first , two bases 200 must be placed adjacent to each other on a flat roof , deck or patio surface . second , a water shed / connector 710 is used to connect the adjacent sides of the two adjacent bases 200 together by a snap connection means through the ribs 220 located on the sides of the base 200 . this locks the two adjacent bases 200 together while also creating a water shield . third , modular panels 230 are connected to the remaining sides of the base 200 through a snap connection means using the ribs 220 located on the sides of the base 200 . the panels 230 should stand vertical on top of the base 200 . fourth , a corner interlocking - post 240 is used to secure the sides of the panels 230 together and further secures the panels 230 to the base 200 . each corner interlocking - post 240 has slots 290 located on two side faces of each post 240 . these slots connect together with the ribs 260 on each side of each panel 230 creating a snap connection feature that locks the interlocking - post 240 to the panel 230 . moreover , each interlocking - post 240 has an extending member 250 which locks into the holes 270 located on each corner of each base 200 . once the panels 230 are connected to the base 200 , on each corner the corner interlocking - post 240 slides in and connects to the sides of each panel 230 and connects to the base with snap connection features with the extending member 250 and hole 270 . in one embodiment , the corner - interlocking posts 240 connects the perpendicular sides of the panels 230 together and further secures each panel 230 to the base 200 . moreover , for the corners located at the shared wall when two adjacent bases 200 are connected ( such as illustrated in fig7 ), the water shed / connector 710 also has tabs on each end ( not shown ) which mate with the slots 290 of the corner interlocking posts 240 . advantageously , this allows users to quickly assemble green spaces to their existing decks , roof and patio surfaces in a custom modular fashion without the use of tools . the average estimated time to assemble two modular roof , deck or patio apparatuses together is about 10 to about 15 minutes . a further feature or benefit of assembling at least two modular roof , deck or patio apparatuses together is that the interior wall is removed which allows for lower cost and more continuous planting space . persons skilled in the art will appreciate alternate connectors or fasteners which may be used for releasably connecting the panels to the base and for releasably connecting adjacent bases together . the present invention also contemplates and accommodates additional modular components and bounded areas - providing for additional design freedom and flexibility . for example , the bases 200 may be releasably connected together for a side - by - side green roof , deck and patio apparatus 100 as illustrated in fig7 . as an additional embodiment , the bases 200 may be releasably connected together creating a “ l ” shaped ( illustrated in fig8 ), a “ t ” shaped ( illustrated in fig9 ), a “+” shaped ( illustrated in fig1 ), or a “ u ” shaped ( illustrated in fig1 ) green roof , deck and patio apparatus 100 . preferred green roof , deck and patio apparatuses 100 hereof are also provided with support add - on components suitable for use for decorative and / or functional purposes to compliment the modular aspects of the green roof , deck and patio apparatus 100 . additional or add - on components may be temporary structures , or they may be semi - permanent structures and other desired above - panel structures that are maintained in the installed green roof , deck and patio apparatus . in carrying out this aspect of the invention , as mentioned above , one embodiment of a suitable add - on component is provided by the addition of a ledge 280 for seating , such as illustrated in fig2 . the additional ledge 280 seating may be a temporary structure which is added on as a snap on feature to an existing modular panel 230 or a semi - permanent structure in which the additional ledge 280 seating is a built in feature of a modular panel 230 . advantageously , ledge 280 seating allows for easier accessibility to the planting area , and with the integral seats , makes gardening physically easier and provides further design flexibility . advantageously , the roof , deck or patio apparatus of the present invention is uniquely adapted for ease of maintenance and repair of both the roof , deck or patio apparatus itself and the underlying roof , deck or patio structure . in accordance with another aspect of the invention , the green roof , deck or patio apparatus is provided for lifting and moving individual bases and panels , for installation of the roof , deck or patio system , and for lifting , removing and replacing individual bases or panels from an installed roof , deck or patio system , without the need to disturb surrounding bases and panels . advantageously , such a non - progressive arrangement , i . e ., the ability to lift and move bases and panels from the installed green roof , deck and patio system without the need to disturb adjacent bases and panels , permits access to portions of the underlying roof , deck or patio surface such as for repair or periodic maintenance or access to drain openings without the need to tear - up and destroy large sections of the green roof , deck or patio systems as with prior systems , and provides the ability to change the green roof , deck or patio design after its initial installation by simply rearranging or replacing desired bases and panels . from the foregoing , it will be apparent that the present invention brings to the art new and improved green roof , deck or patio systems and associated methods , including uniquely configured interlocking modular bases and panels and associated apparatus for use therewith .')
