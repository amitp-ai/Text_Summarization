Prediction
--start-- a method of producing and arrangement for a multi - pane insulating glass structure which has two parallel panes , a frame for holding the panes and an adhesive sealant mounted between the panes and the frame , comprises specially - shaped elongated plastic sectional rods forming portions of the frame and having grooves for receiving the panes with a foil - type vapor seal mounted intermediate first and second ones of the sectional rod portions . the first rod portion is substantially u - shaped in cross - section and forms a spacer for the spaced parallel panes . the u - shaped sectional rod includes a central web for spanning the foil - type vapor seal and forming a chamber for housing a moisture - absorbing agent . --stop--
Target
a collector for dog droppings includes a stick provided with a support bell at its ground - side end . the stick includes at its lower end an extension which projects through the support bell and is rotatable relative thereto . connected to the extension is a receiving insert which includes two semicircular plates with one plate movable relative to the other stationary plate so that the insert can be opened and closed for collecting and retaining the waste in the collector and for subsequent disposal thereof . --stop--

Prediction
--start-- a method of producing a fiber reinforced concrete structure of desired thickness including the steps of extruding a sheet of concrete substantially free of fibers , distributing an effective amount of reinforcing fibers on the sheet , repeating the foregoing steps until the desired thickness is --oov-- and before the concrete sheets have set up , and extruding a further sheet of substantially fiber - free concrete over the structure resulting from the foregoing steps to achieve the desired thickness . the amount of fiber distributed over each sheet may be varied to concentrate the fiber in the areas where the greatest stress concentration is expected . also disclosed is an apparatus for performing the method . --stop--
