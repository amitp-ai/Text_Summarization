# Data Collection for Text Summarization (Capstone Project)
I explored various different datasets for text summarization.  
Use the accompanying Python script (Data_Collection_Script.py) to download the below datasets.

## 1. The Main Dataset
* **Big Patent**
    * This dataset is created using the patents filed with the USPTO.
    * This is a better dataset for text summarization because of it's large size and because target summary contains information that is uniformly distirbuted across the article. So the trained model cannot just cheat, but instead it has to "understand" the article. Refer to [BigPatent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03741.pdf) for details.
    * The article is the patent description and the abstract is the target summary
    * In this dataset, the average article length is 3500 words and average abstract length is 116 words as shown in [BigPatent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03741.pdf)
    * For Tensorflow, use: <https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/big_patent>
    * For other frameworks, the dataset can be downloaded from <https://evasharma.github.io/bigpatent/>

* **Summary**
    * The BigPatent dataset has 1.2M training examples and is 26.2GB in size. It tends to have long articles.  
    * For data consistency, the BigPatent dataset's md5 checksum (for *.tar.gz) is: 1f1c264c29e80c111b3a6a28e81cabbc
    * See below for an example


## 2. Other Datasets Collected/Explored
* **Arxiv and Pubmed Scientific Papers**
    * The article is the body of the paper and abstract is the target summary
    * This dataset is better than the new articles' dataset as explained in [BigPatent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03741.pdf)
    * For Tensorflow, use: <https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/scientific_papers>
    * Dataset can be downloaded from <https://github.com/armancohan/long-summarization>
    
* **CNN/Daily Mail**
    * For Pytorch, can get the dataset easily from <https://huggingface.co/datasets/cnn_dailymail>
    * For Tensorflow, can also easily get the dataset from <https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/cnn_dailymail>
    * But for the sake of experience, I decided to collect the data myself from the source that both Huggingface and Tensorflow uses (as cited in their documentation). **In particular, I collected my data from the original place (b) as shown below**
        1. https://github.com/abisee/cnn-dailymail (This is the best place to start/use as it has links/instructions to get processed and unprocessed data)
        2. https://cs.nyu.edu/~kcho/DMQA/ (original unprocessed dataset. Stories has the data for text summarization. Queestions is used for QA task)
           https://github.com/deepmind/rc-data (the script used to generate the data)
        3. https://github.com/becxer/cnn-dailymail/ (suggested by (a) for unprocessed data and how to process it -- it gets it's data from (b))
        4. https://github.com/JafferWilson/Process-Data-of-CNN-DailyMail (suggested by (a) for processed data. Processed data in binary format for Tensorflow. It also has unprocessed data (probably copied from (b))
        5. This actually has the CNN/DM dataset grouped by train/val/test sets <https://github.com/harvardnlp/sent-summary>. Maybe use this instead as it requires less processing work than (a/b)

* **Gigaword dataset**  
  1. Collected data from <https://github.com/harvardnlp/sent-summary> (Tensorflow data (ii) links here too)
  2. For tensorflow, can also get this dataset from <https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/gigaword>

* **Opinions dataset** (this is too small though, under 20MB. So not collected/used.)

* **Reddit dataset**
  1. https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/reddit (this is a large dataset: ~18GB!)

module 114 . the rotation of the transducer shaft 104 within the catheter body 102 is controlled by the interface module 114 , which provides a plurality of user interface controls that can be manipulated by a user . the interface module 114 also communicates with the transducer subassembly 118 by sending and receiving electrical signals to and from the transducer subassembly 118 via wires within the transducer shaft 104 . the interface module 114 can receive , analyze , and / or display information received through the transducer shaft 104 . it will be appreciated that any suitable

subassembly 118 . the transducer subassembly 118 can be of any suitable type , including but not limited to one or more advanced transducer technologies such as pmut or cmut . the transducer subassembly 118 can include either a single transducer or an array . fig2 shows a rotational ivus probe 200 utilizing a common spinning element 232 . the probe 200 has a catheter 201 with a catheter body 202 and a transducer shaft 204 . as shown , the catheter hub 216 is near the proximal end portion 206 of the catheter body 202 and the proximal end portion 210 of the transducer shaft 204 . the catheter hub 216 includes a stationary hub housing 224 , a dog 226 , a connector 228 , and bearings 230 . the dog 226 mates with a spinning element 232 for alignment of the hub 216 with the interface module 214 and torque transmission to the transducer shaft 204 . the dog 226 rotates within the hub housing 224 utilizing the bearings 230 . the connector 228 in this figure is coaxial . the connector 228 rotates with the spinning element 232 , described further herein . as shown , the interior of the interface module 214 includes a motor 236 , a motor shaft 238 , a printed circuit board ( pcb )

stationary portion 250 and the rotary portion 248 of the transformer 246 and also by placing the windings 251 , 252 as close as possible to each other . advanced transducer technologies can require more than the two conductive signal lines that a single piezoelectric transducer utilizes on a conventional rotational ivus probe . for example , in addition to signal pathways for ultrasound information communicated with the transducer , certain advanced transducer technologies also require a power supply in order to operate . in order to pass the necessary multiple of signals between the advanced transducer technology and the interface module , a suitable structure may be needed to transmit ultrasound signals , power , and any other suitable signals across the boundary between the

to the transducer , the spinning element 332 can be fitted with contacts , such as slip ring contacts 360 , 361 , which are respectively engaged by stationary brushes 362 , 363 within the interface module 314 . each of the slip rings 360 , 361 is coupled to a respective conductive line , such as 355 , in the connector 344 . in other embodiments , the transducer can be powered by an ac power

probe 600 before the signal is communicated across the rotary / stationary boundary . in this embodiment , a wireless communication mechanism is used to transmit the ultrasound signal . any suitable wireless communication mechanism may be used including , but not limited to , wireless mechanisms utilizing radio frequency or infrared . as shown , the wireless communication mechanism includes transmitter and / or receiver components 682 and 684 . the transmitter and / or receiver component 682 can be attached to any suitable location such as the printed circuit board 657 on the spinning element 632 . the transmitter and / or receiver component 684 can likewise be placed in any suitable location including the main printed circuit board 640 in the interface module 614 . therefore , it will be appreciated that signals can be carried across the rotating and stationary mechanical components via any suitable mechanism including , but not limited to , a transformer , an optical coupler , a wireless communication mechanism , a generator , and / or brushes / contacts . in certain embodiments , a transformer , an optical coupler , and / or a wireless communication mechanism can be utilized to carry signals such as an ultrasound signal . in certain embodiments , a transformer , a power generator , and / or brushes / contacts can be utilized to convey power to the transducer . furthermore , the spinning element can have one or more printed circuit boards with a suitable number and type of active electronic components and circuitry , thus making the spinning element an active spinning element . examples of electronic components that can be utilized with the active spinning element include , but are not limited to , power supply circuits ( such as a generator , rectifier , regulator , high voltage step - up converter , etc . ), transmitters ( including tripolar transmitters ), time - gain - control ( tgc ) amplifiers , amplitude and / or phase detectors , adc converters , optical transceivers , encoder circuits , wireless communication components , microcontrollers , and any other suitable components . in addition , the spinning element can include encoder and timing logic such that it can internally generate the transmit triggers , and thus , eliminate the need to communicate a timing signal across the spinning element . through the embodiments described herein , excellent image quality is possible including wide bandwidth , frequency - agility , low ringdown , focused beam ( including dynamically focused beam ), and harmonic capability . as mentioned , any suitable advanced transducer technology may be used , including but not limited to pmut and cmut transducers , either as single transducers or arrays . as an example , a pmut transducer can be formed by depositing a piezoelectric polymer ( such as polyvinylidene fluoride \u2014 pvdf ) onto a micromachined silicon substrate . the silicon substrate can include an amplifier and protection circuit to buffer the signal from the pvdf transducer . it can be important to include the amplifier immediately adjacent to the pvdf element because the capacitance of the electrical cables can dampen the signal from the high impedance pvdf transducer . the amplifier typically requires dc power , transmit input ( s ), and amplifier output connections . the pvdf transducer can be a focused transducer to provide excellent resolution . as mentioned above , having an active spinning element , such as is described herein , permits the utilization of an advanced transducer technology on a rotational ivus probe . in addition , having an active spinning element can facilitate certain advanced operations of the probe . the enhanced bandwidth of the probe utilizing the active spinner permits the probe to obtain information at a plurality of different frequencies . by way of example and not limitation , the probe can be utilized to obtain ultrasound information taken at two diverse frequencies , such as 20 mhz and 40 mhz . it will be appreciated that any suitable frequency and any suitable quantity of frequencies may be used . generally , lower frequency information facilitates a tissue versus blood classification scheme due to the strong frequency dependence of the backscatter coefficient of the blood . higher frequency information generally provides better resolution at the expense of poor differentiation between blood speckle and tissue , which can make it difficult to identify the lumen border . thus , if information is obtained at a lower frequency and a higher frequency , then an algorithm can be utilized to interleave and display the two data sets to obtain frequency - diverse information that is closely aligned in time and space . in result , a high resolution ultrasound image can be produced with clear differentiation between blood and tissue and accurate delineation of vessel borders . the typical 512 a - lines that compose a single frame of an image can be interspersed into alternating high and low frequency a - lines . as an example , a 20 mhz image can show the blood as black and the tissue as gray , while the 40 mhz image can show the blood and tissue as gray and barely , if at all , distinguishable from one another . it can be recognized through a provided algorithm that black in 20 mhz and gray at 40 mhz is blood , gray at both frequencies is tissue , and black at both frequencies is clear fluid . the broadband capability of advanced transducer technologies , such as pmut , facilitated by the active spinning element , can allow for closely interleaved a - lines of two or more different center frequencies , possibly including pulse - inversion a - line pairs to generate harmonic as well as fundamental information , which is then combined to provide a robust classification scheme for tissue versus blood . the dual frequency blood classification scheme can be further enhanced by other blood speckle reduction algorithms such as motion algorithms ( such as chromaflo , q - flow , etc . ), temporal algorithms , harmonic signal processing , etc . it will be appreciated that any suitable algorithm can be used . besides intravascular ultrasound , other types of ultrasound catheters can be made using the teachings provided herein . by way of example and not limitation , other suitable types of catheters include non - intravascular intraluminal ultrasound catheters , intracardiac echo catheters , laparoscopic , and interstitial catheters . in addition , the probe may be used in any suitable anatomy , including , but not limited to , coronary , carotid , neuro , peripheral , or venous . recitation of ranges of values herein are merely intended to serve as a shorthand method of referring individually to each separate value falling within the range , unless otherwise indicated herein , and each separate value is incorporated into the specification as if it were individually recited herein . it will be appreciated that like reference numbers and / or like shown features in the figures can represent like features . it will be appreciated that discussions of like reference numbers and / or like shown features in any embodiment may be applicable to any other embodiment . any references , including publications , patent applications , and patents , cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each reference were individually and specifically indicated to be incorporated by reference and were set forth in its entirety herein ( including any

embodiments will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the foregoing illustrative examples . those skilled in the relevant art will employ such variations as appropriate , and

**Summary**
we study the phase behavior of a nematic liquid crystal confined between a flat substrate with strong anchoring and a patterned substrate whose structure and local anchoring strength we vary . by first evaluating an effective surface free energy function characterizing the patterned substrate we derive an expression for the effective free energy of the confined nematic liquid crystal . then we determine phase diagrams involving a homogeneous state in which the nematic director is almost uniform and a hybrid aligned nematic state in which the orientation of the director varies through the cell . direct minimization of the free energy functional were performed in order to test the predictions of the effective free energy method . we find remarkably good agreement between the phase boundaries calculated from the two approaches . in addition the effective energy method allows one to determine the energy barriers between two states in a bistable nematic device .

The Supreme Court displayed some discomfort on Wednesday as it tried to resolve a testy international custody fight. Deep divisions were apparent from the bench, as the justices tried to sort out competing allegations raised by the parents and proper legal remedies. At issue is whether an appeal of an American judge's order allowing a child to go back to Scotland with the mother becomes moot under the terms of an international treaty since the child is no longer in the United States. Lynne Chafin and her lawyers say the purpose of the Hague Convention treaty was to stop children like her 5-year-old daughter, Eris, from bouncing back and forth between countries over custody. But the girl's father, Jeffrey Chafin, says the custody fight began in American courts where the girl was living at the time, and that his legal claims were never fully heard in those federal courts. A majority on the high court appeared to offer some level of support to the father's legal position, during a tense hour of oral arguments. The word "unfortunate" was mentioned several times by the justices over the entire "he-said, she-said" parental disagreements. "The incentives if you prevail are for the custodial, or the parent with control over the child, to leave immediately," Chief Justice John Roberts told the mother's lawyer. "Even after a motion for a stay has been filed. Get on the first plane out and then you're home free. That seems to me to be a very unfortunate result." Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said to the father's lawyer that the purpose of the international treaty was to eliminate "shuttling of children" across courts in different nations, a process she said could take years. An eventual ruling in the case of Chafin v. Chafin could establish an important precedent on the discretion of U.S. courts to decide where children caught in custody fights should stay. In the middle of this case is Eris, who now resides in a remote part of the United Kingdom with her mother. Army Sgt. Jeff Chafin is based at Ft. Stewart, Georgia. He claims she is an unfit mother. She was once arrested for disorderly conduct after a night of drinking and was deported for overstaying her visa. She claims he is manipulative. Back in her home country without her daughter, Lynne filed a "Petition for Return of Child to Scotland" under the 1980 Hague Convention's Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. It grants parents in general a "right of custody" and a separate "right of access," ensuring the laws of one country are respected in the others. More than 80 nations are a party to the treaty, including the United States and the United Kingdom. Lynne did not see her daughter for 10 months while the custody case played in a federal court in Alabama. Just hours after a federal judge allowed Lynne to take the child to Scotland, the two were on an overseas flight. A federal appeals court later said the matter was out of its hands since the child was now in another country, ruling the issue was moot. Both sides disagree on whether the father moved quickly enough to appeal the immediate removal order in an appropriate court. Now the justices will decide the jurisdictional questions. Michael Manely, the father's attorney, told the justices that the issue was not moot and that the child should be brought back to the United States while courts here resolve the matter. "When you say bring the child back, there's an impediment to that because now this court in Scotland has told her don't-- the child stays here," said Ginsburg. "There's an order that the child not be removed from Scotland." Tougher questions were aimed at Stephen Cullen, attorney for Lynne Chafin, who said "once the doors close on that plane and that child arrives back in Scotland, unless the plane turns round and comes back again, it is all over" on any appeals. "You're not going to suggest all those countries that permit appeals explicitly and stop removals until appeals are finished, that those contracting treaty parties are breaching the convention, are you?" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor skeptically. Roberts -- the only justice with young children -- suggested the father was not given a proper time or opportunity to appeal once the initial removal order was signed by the federal judge in Alabama. "It seems to me," he said, "the best thing is to hold things up briefly, so that the child doesn't go overseas and then have to be brought back, particularly if you have situations where there can be an expeditious appeal. And I think most appellate courts would appreciate the benefit of that." Justice Stephen Breyer said just because the child is in Scotland, does not mean federal courts in the United States still have no role to play. "I don't understand why you want a treaty where the best interests of the child are what's at issue, and then you interpret it in a way that the court of one nation with the child where you have parents from both nations pays no attention at all to what courts in other nations are saying." Jeff Chafin was in the courtroom for the morning arguments, dressed in his Army dress uniform. "I told my little girl I would do everything I could to get her," Sgt. Chafin told CNN National Correspondent Joe Johns this week, "to make sure she's safe." He last visited the girl overseas a few weeks ago. "I don't believe that (the current legal fight) is in the best interest of the child as it's going to go on for years and years to come," Lynne Hales Chafin told CNN. A ruling is due in a few months. The case is Chafin v. Chafin (11-1347).

**Summary**
Case involves girl living with mother in Scotland; husband is in U.S. Custody case tests bounds of international treaty over custody rights. An eventual ruling could establish an important precedent.

An Oregon couple were lucky to escape injury after their dog triggered a trip wire that was attached to a homemade gun in the woods last week. Mike and Jennifer Colbach. of Portland, were hiking in Forest Park last Thursday when they noticed two men who 'were acting really hinky'. The pair appeared out of nowhere and Mike said they looked like 'the back end of a robbery', according to The Oregonian. While walking into the main trail, Mike and Jennifer noticed a parachute cord on the ground, which they avoided, but their dog Rhoda stepped on. 

Scroll down for video.
Investigating: Mike Colbach (right) and his dog Rhoda returned to a trail near their home outside Forest Park   in Portland, Oregon to show police a trip wire attached to an improvised gun on the trail last week. Lucky escape: Fortunately no one was injured when the dog tripped the wire. The couple realized that something was moving in the trees and, somewhat alarmed, quickly left. However Mike Colbach was troubled about what happened on their regular walking route and went back to investigate a few days later. He discovered the cord was rigged up through the trees to a makeshift gun. The weapon was made from a pipe, that was opened one end and closed the other. At the closed end was a firing pin, and inside the pipe was a shotgun shell. Tripping the parachute cord was meant to trigger a beer bottle that would swing down and hit the firing pin, causing the bullet to fire. However it must have malfunctioned with the Colbach's dog stepped on in it. 'Members of the bomb squad told me, ''Dude, you had a shotgun shell pointed right at your head - twice'','Mr Colbach told The Oregonian after reporting the matter to police. Mike Colbach said the parachute cord was rigged to a three-quarter-inch-diameter pipe - open at one end, closed at the other - attached to a tree. Scene: The incident occurred in Forest Park, a popular hiking and walking spot in Portland, Oregon. Police have taken the weapon as evidence. Authorities said it was rare to see such a device in a public park, as they tend to be more common in rural areas where people are trying to protect something. No other such booby traps have been found in the park. Mr Colbach believes it was the work of the two men they saw.

**Summary**
Device was found at Forest Park in Portland, Oregon. It was a metal pipe with a firing pin loaded with a shotgun shell. Rigged up to a tree so that a wire would trip and a bottle would hit the firing pin. The device malfunction when it was tripped by Mike Colbach's dog, Rhoda. Police have now seized it and are looking for two men seen hanging around the park.
