In the spirit of quick proto-typing of these different models, we will initially limit the size of the data to 128 training examples and 16 validation examples. And we will try to overfit to the training data with as small of a model as possible. Thereafter we will scale-up some of the higher performing models and train them using 5000 training examples. Moreover, we will also experiment with different models covered in the advanced unit on NLP such as LSTMs, Transformers, etc. **Hence, this notebook serves as my submission for steps 8, 9, and 10 (i.e. units 20.5.1, 20.5.2, and 20.5.3) of the capstone project.**  \n","\n","In particular, we will build various deep learning based models for text summarization. The common thread among all these models is that they are based upon an encoder-decoder architecture where encoder \"encodes\" the text to be summarized into a compressed form representing the underlying meaning of the input text. The decoder then takes this representation to generate a succinct summary of the input text. Refer to the literature review notebook for further details on this architecture.  \n","\n","At a high level, we will experiment with three different model types:\n","1. LSTM\n","\n","2. Attention based LSTM  \n","While LSTM is better than a simple RNN in capturing long term dependencies (b'cse it addresses the problem of vanishing gradients suffered by RNNs), it is still fairly limited because we are expecting too much out of it. Specifically, we expect the internal state of an LSTM cell at step t to capture all the relevant information from steps 0 to t-1 -- which is a lot to ask for as t gets very large. This is especially problematic for this dataset where the input text is about 4000 words long. To address this limitation, we use a multiplication based global attention mechanism over the encoded input.\n","\n","3. Transformers  \n","While the above attention mechanism allows the decoder in directly attending to the input text at any time step, it still has significant limitations. Specifically, it does not have self-attention in the encoder and decoder modules -- because it only performs cross attention from the decoder to the encoder module. So the encoder and decoder modules still rely on the LSTM's ability to capture long term dependencies, which is fairly limited. To address these limitations, we use transformers because of their ability to directly attend to a token at any time step in one step. Moreover, due to their parallel nature (vs. the sequential nature of LSTMs), it is much faster to train transformers on a GPU.\n","\n","4. Memory Efficient Transformer  \n","A major drawback of vanilla transformers is its huge memory consumption. In particular, the self-attention matrix inside the encoder layer is of size input_length x input_length which for a 4000 words input with a batch size of 32 and float32 representation takes 2GB of memory. And this is just for a single attention head in a single layer inside a multi-layer multi-head attention based encoder. And so it becomes very challenging to train with any reasonable batch size without compromising on the number of layers or the hidden dimension size.  \n","To address this, we can take advantage of the fact that in most cases, tokens don't need to attend across words that are thousands of time steps away. That is, the input text does not generally have this super long dependency structure. So we can split the input text into, for example, four chunks of 1100 words inputs with an overlap of 100 tokens to allow for cross attention across these chunks. This leads to ~4x reduction in memory consumption. And the encoder outputs of these four input chunks are concatenated together before being fed to the decoder.  \n","\n","Moreover, for each model type, in order to get the optimal performance, we'll experiment with various hyperparameters such as number of hidden dimensions, number of encoder and decoder layers, dropout, etc. Furthermore, we'll also experiment with limited \"teacher-forcing\" i.e. not teacher forcing 100% of the time but only 70% instead -- inorder to make the training process be closer to the evaluation process. Moreover, for memory efficient version of transformers, we'll experiment with weight sharing between the decoder embeddings and the decoder output projection matrix as per the \"attention is all you need\" paper. We'll further experiment with scaling-up the embedding's output before adding to the positional embeddings vector inorder to give the word embeddings more influence vs positional encodings, as per the \"attention is all you need\" paper.  \n","\n","As can be seen below, the highest Rouge-1 score we can get using LSTM based model is 29.5%. Overall, the best performing model (MODEL_7) is using transformers and it achieves Rouge-1 score of 38.4%, which is much better than the baseline Lead-3 model's Rouge-1 score of 31.3%. Moreover, rouge scores of the transformer based model on the training data approaches 99%; and so, it has high variance. I tried to experiment by adding dropout or reduce model complexity to mitigate high variance, but it didn't improve validation score. I believe that adding alot more training data coupled with an even larger model will help reduce variance and thus get an even higher Rouge score. Unfortunately however, I was not able to experiment much with more than 5000 training examples due to the large training time. For example, with 5000 training examples, it took about 3.5 hours to train a transformer based model on a P100 GPU.  \n","\n","One point I'd like to make is that human text summarization is subjective, and so using a fixed metric to measure it will not be perfect. It is important to note that the Rouge metric just compares the generated text to a reference text, and this can cause a couple problems:\n","1. Intolerance to paraphrasing. Even a well paraphrased version of the reference text will lead to a low Rouge score.  For example, if we replace a word with its synonym, the Rouge score will decrease. This is because Rouge measures syntactical matching as opposed to semantical matching between the reference and predicted summaries.\n","2. They tend to reward extractive summaries more than abstractive summaries even if a human would evaluate both summaries as equally good. It is widely observed that just selecting the first 3 sentences from a text (i.e. the baseline Lead-3 model) will result in pretty good Rouge scores, even though a human evaluator may not give such high scores to it. See slides 25-26 of https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P17-1099/ for details.  \n","\n","For the decoder module, as it is really a language generation model, in addition to the greedy approach of choosing a word (at each time step) with the highest probability amongst all the words in the vocabulary, I also experimented with beam search. In theory, beam search should be able to generate sentences with higher probability, and thus rouge scores; but I did not observe any improvement. Perhaps it is due to a flaw in my implementation of beam search; so I will revisit it in the future.  \n","\n","In terms of framework, Pytorch is used to train the models and Tensorboard (integrated with Pytorch) to visualize the training process.\n","\n","All the code is in the [src directory](https://github.com/amitp-ai/Text_Summarization_UCSD/tree/main/ModelBuilding/src) inside the capstone project's GitHub repository, whereby models.py contains the code for building all the different models, train.py is used for training the models, evaluate.py is used for model evaluations, and utils.py contains various utility methods and classes.\n","\n","Lastly, we will use cpc_codes 'de' from the BigPatent dataset for training and validating the models.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8ej8yLC6KbIz"},"source":["## Mount Google Drive and Import Libraries"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"-8BlEalhJt6O","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1622298793404,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":28521,"user":{"displayName":"Amit Patel","photoUrl":"","userId":"14428842836414406555"}},"outputId":"33d16663-5a46-496e-bccb-16062a4bcb0f"},"source":["# Mount Google Drive\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"kN_j2lJNKABX","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1622298803658,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":5272,"user":{"displayName":"Amit Patel","photoUrl":"","userId":"14428842836414406555"}},"outputId":"1bd74480-a34b-424b-e972-12c7ded73f39"},"source":["# import sys\n","import os\n","import torch\n","# for auto-reloading external modules (automatically reloads before using an imported module)\n","# %load_ext autoreload\n","# %autoreload 2\n","\n","#To ensure that the Colab Python interpreter can load Python files from within\n","PATH_NAME = os.path.join('/', 'content', 'drive', 'My Drive', 'Colab Notebooks', 'UCSDX_MLE_Bootcamp', 'Text_Summarization_UCSD', 'ModelBuilding')\n","%cd $PATH_NAME\n","# sys.path.append(os.path.join(PATH_NAME, 'src'))\n","# print(sys.path)\n","\n","print(f'Torch version {torch.__version__}') #1.8.1+cu101"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/UCSDX_MLE_Bootcamp/Text_Summarization_UCSD/ModelBuilding\n","Torch version 1.8.1+cu101\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"6sASbLseT2nA","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1622298806572,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":204,"user":{"displayName":"Amit Patel","photoUrl":"","userId":"14428842836414406555"}},"outputId":"26a702c5-f5e6-46a8-c580-57df1bbabab5"},"source":["!nvidia-smi"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Sat May 29 14:33:26 2021       \n","+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n","| NVIDIA-SMI 465.19.01    Driver Version: 460.32.03    CUDA Version: 11.2     |\n","|-------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\n","| GPU  Name        Persistence-M| Bus-Id        Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.
